This study aimed to present Chinese data on CTIT and organ bleeding in patients undergoing emergency oncology. This retrospective study was conducted in the Oncology Emergency Department. We evaluated the clinical features and outcomes of CTIT and associated organ hemorrhage. A retrospective analysis collected data from 8590 cases of malignant tumor emergency visits. Among these, 1164 cases (13.5%) of CTIT met the inclusion criteria, with a median patient age of 61\u2009years. 61 (5.24%) of the 1164 CTIT cases were associated with overt organ hemorrhage. Independent risk factors predicting CTIT deterioration included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 2-4 (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20094.883), stage IV (OR\u2009=\u20092.275), organ bleeding (OR\u2009=\u20093.029), anemia (OR\u2009=\u20093.243), and fever (OR\u2009=\u20095.360), all with p\u2009<\u20090.05. Among the 61 cases with bleeding, 41% (25\/61) involved lung cancer. The bleeding group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with fever (11.5% vs. 2.9%), pleural effusion (25.0% vs. 9.8%), and malnutrition requiring parenteral nutritional support (9.8% vs. 2.8%) compared to the non-bleeding group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Fever (OR\u2009=\u20094.886, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and pleural effusion (OR\u2009=\u20094.812, p\u2009=\u20090.007) were identified as independent risk factors for CTIT-related bleeding. Malignancies associated with reduced platelet counts and additional risk factors require heightened clinical vigilance for hemorrhage development.","1":"Tuvusertib is an investigational, orally administered inhibitor of ATR protein kinase, currently in Phase II clinical development. Here, we present an integrated nonclinical and clinical assessment of the effect of tuvusertib on QTc interval. In\u00a0vitro inhibition by tuvusertib of the hERG potassium channel was evaluated, and in\u00a0vivo ECG assessments evaluated the effect on QTc in dogs. PK-matched triplicate ECGs in patients receiving tuvusertib in Part A1 of the Phase I DDRiver Solid Tumors 301 study (N\u2009=\u200955; dosing regimens: 5-270\u2009mg QD, 180-220\u2009mg QD 2\u2009weeks on\/1\u2009week off, or 150\u2009mg BID 4\u2009days on\/3\u2009days off) contributed to concentration-QTc analyses via linear mixed-effects modeling. In\u00a0vitro, tuvusertib inhibited hERG with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 2.83\u2009\u03bcM, which is ~2.5 times its steady-state unbound C<sub>max<\/sub> at the clinical RDE (180\u2009mg QD 2\u2009weeks on\/1\u2009week off). In\u00a0vivo, tuvusertib did not affect QTc up to 5\u2009mg\/kg\/day in dogs (unbound C<sub>max<\/sub> comparable to that at clinical RDE). In patients with advanced solid tumors receiving tuvusertib at up to threefold higher plasma concentrations than at the RDE, the risk for clinically relevant QTc prolongation was assessed to be low (upper limit of 90% CI of model-predicted \u0394QTcF <\u200920\u2009ms). There was no relationship between tuvusertib plasma concentration and RR interval, suggesting no effect on HR. Early integrated concentration-QTc assessments of tuvusertib monotherapy in Phase I were crucial in informing the low risk for clinically relevant QTc prolongation, thereby facilitating efficient evaluation of investigational tuvusertib combination strategies in ongoing clinical development.","2":"We aimed to describe treatment patterns of patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) who progressed after receiving darolutamide in a real-world setting, and according to the standard clinical practice in Spain. This was a multicenter, observational, retrospective study conducted at the urology and oncology departments of 17 Spanish hospitals that participated in the ARAMIS trial and its rollover study. 85 patients, with a median age of 76\u00a0years, were included in the study. 49 patients (57.6%) progressed to mCRPC, with metastases located mainly in bone. Only 35 of them (71.4%) received at least one subsequent therapy. The most common first-line treatments after darolutamide were abiraterone (n\u2009=\u200922, 63%) and docetaxel (n\u2009=\u200910, 29%), with a median (IQR) treatment duration of 7.6\u00a0months (4.7, 12.7) and 4.8\u00a0months (3.8, 5.8), respectively; besides, the most frequent first-line\/second-line treatment sequences were abiraterone-docetaxel and docetaxel-cabazitaxel. In addition, only 20% of patients with bone metastases received osteoclast-targeted therapy. These real-world practice patterns suggest a lack of consensus in Spanish clinical practice for the management of patients with mCRPC, indicating that there is a need for more standardized strategies and unification of the criteria to make decisions in accordance with the recommendations of international clinical practice guidelines. Not applicable.","3":"Ramucirumab, a VEGFR-2-targeting monoclonal antibody, has been widely adopted in the treatment of various solid tumors. However, its safety profile in routine clinical practice remains incompletely understood. To address this, we examined adverse event reports associated with ramucirumab collected in the FAERS database between 2014 and 2024. Following careful deduplication, 3,435 reports were analyzed, identifying 139 Preferred Terms with significant signals across four disproportionality methods. In addition to well-established toxicities such as gastrointestinal perforation, hemorrhage, hypertension, and proteinuria, several previously underrecognized events were detected, including heart failure, chylothorax, and pseudocirrhosis. Gastrointestinal perforation events were particularly frequent and often occurred within the first three months of therapy. Temporal analyses indicated that the early treatment period is critical for the onset of severe adverse events. While the FAERS data cannot confirm causality, these findings underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring, especially during the initial phase of treatment, and highlight areas for further clinical and mechanistic investigation into the safety risks of ramucirumab.","4":"No abstract available","5":"Anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have changed the treatment landscape of many advanced malignancies. However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) bring great challenges to clinical benefits. The prediction of irAEs is urgently demanded for early detection and intervention. Patients in our center who received anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy between January 2019 and May 2023 were collected. Logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis with 10-fold cross-validation was performed to identify the most relevant variables associated with irAEs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build a prediction model by introducing features selected in LASSO regression analysis. Overall, 680 eligible patients were included, of whom 330 patients were included in the irAEs group. In the irAEs group, 455 different irAEs were reported, of which 52 events were grade 3 or higher in severity. Endocrinal toxicities (174\/680, 25.59%) were the most commonly reported irAEs. Through LASSO and logistic regression analysis, we developed a risk assessment model to predict the risk of irAEs based on basophil percentage (BASO%), hemoglobin (Hb), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), blood urea nitrogen level (BUN), the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), and hepatitis B\/hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. The model had a C-index of 0.727, with good discrimination and calibration capabilities. The prediction model developed in our study can screen and monitor patients with high risk of developing irAEs. It may improve prognosis for pan-cancer patients receiving anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy.","6":"We developed a CancerMaster-targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panel covering 524 key genes specifically designed for the multidimensional molecular profiling of solid tumors. We aimed to establish CancerMaster as an asynchronous and parallel one-stop automated analysis pipeline with a reporting system to overcome the delay in existing NGS approaches. This panel can detect common genomic alteration types, including single nucleotide variants\/indels and copy number variants (CNVs), fusions, Epstein-Barr virus\/human papillomavirus infection, microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, and human leukocyte antigen typing. Using reference materials, CancerMaster demonstrated 100% reproducibility, 99% analytical sensitivity, and high accuracy (94%). Analytical performance for other biomarker classes-including CNVs, fusions, MSI, TMB, and viral detection-was evaluated separately. In a cohort of 668 patients, we identified actionable mutations, including in TP53, KRAS, and PIK3CA, and CNVs, e.g., ERBB2 amplification in gastric (n\u2009=\u2009412) and colorectal (n\u2009=\u200966) cancers. MSI and TMB were strongly correlated in all patients (n\u2009=\u2009668, r\u2009=\u20090.75; p\u2009<\u200910<sup>-\u200915<\/sup>), with consistent results in the gastric (n\u2009=\u2009412, r\u2009=\u20090.75; p\u2009<\u200910<sup>-\u200915<\/sup>) and colorectal (n\u2009=\u200966, r\u2009=\u20090.87; p\u2009<\u200910<sup>-\u200915<\/sup>) cancer groups. Furthermore, directly comparing with the TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO500) panel, CancerMaster demonstrated high concordance while uniquely identifying certain clinically relevant alterations, including an ERBB2 missense mutation. Hence, the CancerMaster panel demonstrated high analytical performance and strong clinical potential for supporting clinical decisions regarding personalized cancer treatment.","7":"The dynamic development towards robotic-assisted surgery particularly affects operative gynecology. The analysis of operative data from robotic-assisted procedures since the first application at a surgical center provides valuable insights into the introduction phase and integration of the DaVinci system into routine clinical operations, as well as their impact on patient care. The aim of this work was to specifically examine the learning curve progression and to present the trend of the professionalization process in implementing the methodology in gynecologic oncology. A retrospective data analysis was conducted of the first n\u2009=\u2009107 patients who underwent surgery for a gynecological malignancy with the DaVinci surgical system at the University Medical Center Freiburg between 2020 and 2022. Classic operative parameters were evaluated, including preparation time, skin-to-skin time, console time, and the resulting learning curves of the surgeons and the operative team (including CUSUM analysis and linear regression models). Additionally, perioperative patient characteristics were recorded (e.g., blood loss, length of hospitalization, conversion rate). The average operative preparation time is 26.11\u2009\u00b1\u20098.13\u00a0min. The maximum value (CUSUM peak) is at approximately 20 performed procedures, indicating that the processes of operative preparation were mastered after this number of operations. The average skin-to-skin time is 172.84\u2009\u00b1\u200971.68\u00a0min (range 43-387\u00a0min), whereby after an initial reduction in skin-to-skin time within the first 30 cases, there was a slight increase in the further course with renewed reduction from approximately 65 procedures. The average console time for all tumor entities is 131.98\u2009\u00b1\u200963.74\u00a0min; for the most common operative indication (endometrial cancer, n\u2009=\u200961), it is 109.89\u2009\u00b1\u200952.04\u00a0min (range 48-221\u00a0min). In the surgeons' learning curves, the two surgeons with the most procedures show a CUSUM peak after 11 and 22 procedures, respectively. The average length of stay is 5.00\u00a0days (\u00b1\u20092.30). A total of two conversions occurred (conversion rate\u2009=\u20091.9%). Upon evaluation of the first n\u2009=\u2009107 DaVinci operations, rapid learnability of robotic-assisted operations was demonstrated. The conversion rate was low at 1.9%. A positive effect on the learning curve of individual surgeons was evident after approximately 20 procedures. Both the preparation time and the skin-to-skin time could be rapidly reduced, so that integration into routine clinical operations was possible without problems.","8":"Cancer mortality is associated with modifiable health behaviors such as physical activity, alcohol intake, and diet; however, it is estimated that only 5-25% of cancer survivors adhere to health behavior recommendations after diagnosis. With the overburdened infrastructure of healthcare in the United States and the high out-of-pocket expenditures for cancer patients, it is challenging for cancer survivors to access personalized lifestyle medicine in many settings. In this Perspective, an interdisciplinary team of cancer rehabilitation and lifestyle medicine clinicians outline the potential for synergy between the two fields to illustrate the possibilities for improvement in cancer care when the two disciplines are integrated. We outline key concepts and present a case example from Re-invent, Integrate, Strengthen, Expand (RISE), an occupational therapy-based cancer survivorship clinic employing the tenets of lifestyle medicine in a major urban medical center in the United States. Cancer rehabilitation clinicians are uniquely situated to collaborate with lifestyle medicine clinicians in the assessment of lifestyle-related issues and interventions designed to mitigate these issues. The RISE cancer survivorship clinic provides a practical, real-life example of this collaboration in action. Cancer care throughout the continuum may benefit from an increase in synergistic activities between these two professional domains.","9":"Improving patients' quality of life during and after their illness has become a major objective in the field of oncology. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of stress management sessions on improving quality of life upon discharge in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. Patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery were randomized between a group that received perioperative stress management sessions as part of an Enhanced Rehabilitation After Surgery (ERAS) program and a group that did not. Outcomes were assessed using questionnaires before, during, and at discharge from hospitalization. Well-being, fatigue score, and quality of life were assessed using the Manifestations of Psychological Well-Being Scale (EMMBEP), the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), and the FACT-C scale (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal), respectively. Pain and sleep were assessed using a Visual Analog Scale. The effectiveness of stress management sessions was evaluated at discharge, and patient satisfaction was assessed at one month. Length of hospital stay and complications were compared between the two groups. Of a total of 154 patients who were randomized in the study, four patients were excluded because they did not undergo surgery, leaving 74 in the control group and 76 in the experimental group. The results showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographics. Stress management sessions did not improve patients' quality of life at discharge. Preoperative well-being was inversely correlated with the MFI fatigue score (P<0.001). Length of hospital stay and postoperative complications were not influenced by stress management sessions. Perioperative stress management sessions for colorectal cancer did not demonstrate a positive impact on quality of life at hospital discharge, and neither length of hospital stay nor postoperative complication rates were influenced by stress management sessions.","10":"Despite increasing numbers of women entering medicine, they remain underrepresented in surgical specialties, particularly in leadership and academic roles. This study explored gender differences in perceptions of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) among members of the European Society of Surgical Oncology (ESSO) and identified areas where DEI policies may better support female surgeons. A cross-sectional electronic survey was distributed to ESSO members in 2025. Quantitative items assessed demographics and perceptions of DEI within respondents' organisations and ESSO. Gender differences were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U tests and binomial logistic regression adjusted for age and ethnicity. Open-text responses were analysed thematically to identify perceived barriers and priorities for improvement. A total of 279 members responded (37% women). Women were less likely than men to perceive recruitment as unbiased (53% vs 17% disagreed, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) or to believe that equal opportunities for advancement exist (43% vs 19% disagreed, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Nearly 40% of women reported their identity had negatively impacted career progression compared with 8% of men (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Women were more likely to prioritise greater representation of women in leadership and faculty roles (OR 8.58, 95% CI 4.73-15.57, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), development of work-life balance guidelines (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.44-4.10, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and commitment to gender diversity in leadership and committees (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.02-2.94, p\u00a0=\u00a00.041). Female surgeons continue to face inequities in surgical oncology. ESSO and similar societies have a critical role in promoting transparent recruitment, inclusive leadership, and equitable professional development to advance gender equity and excellence in cancer care.","11":"This systematic review aimed to examine how mindfulness approaches affect pain, symptom cluster severity, and quality of life among adolescents receiving cancer chemotherapy. Contrasting with prior syntheses emphasizing adult populations or isolated symptoms, this investigation specifically targets symptom clusters in adolescent cancer patients (aged 10-19 years), a unique population requiring specialized nursing care approaches given their distinct developmental characteristics. A comprehensive literature evaluation was conducted across Scopus, Cochrane Embase, PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), and ProQuest databases for publications in English and Thai from 2014 to 2024. Independent researchers conducted quality evaluation using established JBI appraisal tools. Information was synthesized through quantitative analysis employing random-effects modeling to address methodological heterogeneity between controlled and uncontrolled investigations. From 299 identified publications, three investigations (n = 141) satisfied inclusion requirements. Participants received individualized mindfulness-based yoga protocols incorporating breathing techniques, physical movements, and relaxation practices. Analysis revealed predominantly nonsignificant outcomes across symptom measures. Uncontrolled studies demonstrated considerable heterogeneity for pain (I\u00b2 = 84%) and sleep (I\u00b2 = 86%) with no overall meaningful effects. The randomized trial showed no significant between-group differences for symptom measures. Uncontrolled studies indicated modest enhancement in cancer-specific quality of life aspects (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.55, p = .05); however, controlled comparison revealed no significant between-group changes for quality of life indicators. Evidence confidence was rated as low to extremely low across all measures due to high heterogeneity. This first systematic synthesis of MBIs for adolescent cancer populations identifies limited current efficacy but reveals critical evidence gaps. Findings highlight the need for rigorous, age-appropriate, nursing-led interventions that integrate mindfulness with other evidence-based strategies to address multidimensional symptom clusters in pediatric oncology care. Pain management nurses play an integral role in advancing nonpharmacological approaches to symptom management for adolescents with cancer. Mindfulness-based interventions may have potential to enhance holistic care and support patients and families in coping with treatment-related symptoms; however, the current evidence base remains limited and of variable quality. Accordingly, these interventions should be interpreted with caution, and additional rigorous, nursing-led research is warranted to determine their efficacy, feasibility, and sustainability in pediatric oncology practice.

This multicenter retrospective study included 2592 endometrial cancer patients with defined molecular classification and SLN mapping. Continuous variables are reported as medians. Tumors were classified as POLE-mutated, mismatch repair-deficient, p53-abnormal, or no specific molecular profile. When hormone receptor status was available, no specific molecular profile tumors were further sub-classified according to European Society of Gynaecological Oncology\/European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology\/European Society of Pathology 2025 criteria. Molecular sub-types exhibited distinct phenotypes: POLE-mutated tumors occurred in younger patients (median 56 years), with the lowest body mass index (27.0 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>), smallest tumor size (26 mm), and the lowest nodal metastasis rate (8.0%); p53-abnormal tumors affected older patients (67 years), with the largest tumors (35 mm), frequent non-endometrioid histology (78.4%), and the highest nodal metastasis rate (26.1%); mismatch repair-deficient tumors showed intermediate age (63 years), body mass index (28.5), predominantly endometrioid histology (90.4%), substantial lymphovascular space invasion (28.3%), and a 19.4% nodal metastasis rate; no specific molecular profile tumors, the most common group (55.6%), had the highest body mass index (29.0 kg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>), were low-grade in 84.2% of cases and endometrioid in 92.5%, and exhibited a low metastasis rate (11.0%). Among no specific molecular profile tumors with available hormone receptor status, a high-risk-like sub-group (22%), characterized by hormone receptor negativity and\/or high-grade histology, displayed aggressive features macro-metastases (18.2%), SLN mapping failure (24.3%), substantial lymphovascular space invasion (33.2%), deep myometrial invasion (54.3%), and cervical stromal involvement (23.1%) (resembling a \"p53-abnormal-like\" phenotype despite their molecular profile). At multivariate analysis, molecular sub-type was not an independent predictor of nodal involvement (p=.20) or SLN mapping failure (p=.75). Molecular sub-types in endometrial cancer reflect distinct and reproducible phenotypes. However, classic histopathologic features remain the strongest predictors of nodal spread and SLN detection failure.","13":"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating host immunity, metabolism and inflammation, with accumulating evidence linking its composition and function to the development and progression of cancers in the reproductive tract. Patients with ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers exhibit distinct alterations in their gut microbiota, characterised by reduced microbial diversity and shifts towards taxa associated with dysbiosis and chronic inflammation. Mechanistically, gut-derived metabolites and microbial translocation appear to influence systemic immune responses and oestrogen metabolism, thereby fostering a tumour microenvironment conducive to cancer growth. Beyond its role in tumourigenesis, the gut microbiota also affects treatment outcomes. Dysbiosis can reduce sensitivity to chemotherapy and alter immunotherapy responses, while antibiotic use during cancer treatment has been linked to poorer prognosis. Clinically, these insights highlight emerging applications of microbiome modulation as biomarkers for patient stratification and as adjuvant approaches to enhance therapeutic efficacy in gynaecological oncology, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting the microbiota-through dietary interventions, probiotics or faecal microbiota transplantation-to improve cancer treatment outcomes. However, most of these applications remain investigational, and current evidence is limited by heterogeneity across study designs, patient cohorts and cancer subtypes. This review summarises current understanding of gut microbiota profiles in reproductive tract cancers, examines potential mechanisms by which the microbiota influences malignancy, discusses its impact on therapy response and explores its emerging role in precision oncology.","14":"A Marjolin ulcer is a cutaneous malignant growth typically associated with areas of prior injury and irritation, most commonly burn wounds. This case report documents a rare example of a sacral Marjolin ulcer that presented in a patient with a history of lower-back abscesses. There are numerous accounts of this malignancy arising in chronic wounds over many years, but reports of subacute presentations are scarcer. This report underlines the importance of early suspicion and diagnosis in patients who may not have the classic features.","15":"Study DesignRetrospective cohort study.ObjectivesAs cancer survival improves, metastatic spinal cancer has become increasingly common worldwide. Given the high resource demands of spinal oncology care, tools to optimize perioperative planning are essential. The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool (RAPT) in predicting post-operative needs in patients undergoing surgery for spinal tumors.MethodsConsecutive patients (n = 384) undergoing spinal oncology surgery were enrolled and prospectively assessed with RAPT. Coarsened exact matching (CEM) was used to retrospectively isolate risk factors associated with outcomes. Enrolled patients with a low RAPT score (\u22649, n = 44) were exact matched against high-scoring patients (10-12, n = 44). The primary outcome of interest was post-acute care disposition; secondary outcomes were 30- and 90- day ED visits, readmissions, and reoperations. McNemar's test was utilized for matched comparisons.ResultsA low RAPT score was significantly associated with non-home discharge (OR = 4.33 [1.23, 15.20], <i>P<\/i> = 0.02) and 30-day readmission (OR = 3.66 [1.02, 13.14], 0.03). Among low-scoring patients, 31.8% required post-acute care (while only 11.3% of high-scoring patients required post-acute care). A low RAPT score was not associated with ER visits, reoperation, or mortality. Isolation of the RAPT walk score alone significantly predicted non-home discharge (OR = 2.8 [1.01, 7.78], <i>P<\/i> = 0.04).ConclusionsWhen applied prospectively before spinal cancer surgery, the RAPT tool and its subcomponents effectively predict post-acute care needs. Pre-operative prediction of non-home discharge may help guide in-hospital resource allocation and post-acute care of spinal oncology patients.","16":"Latently infected cells persist in people living with HIV (PWH) despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and evade immune clearance. Shock and Kill cure strategies are hampered by insufficient enhancement of targeted immune responses following latency reversal. We previously demonstrated autologous V\u03b42 T cells from PWH retain anti-HIV activity and can reduce CD4+ T cell reservoirs, although their use in cure approaches is limited due to their dual role as a viral reservoir. However, promising clinical data in oncology shows their unique MHC- unrestricted antigen recognition affords potent on-target cytotoxicity in the absence of graft-versus-host disease when used as an allogeneic adoptive cell therapy modality. Here, we found expanded allogeneic V\u03b42 T cells specifically eliminated HIV-infected CD4+ T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), overcoming inherent resistance to killing by other cell types such as NK and CD8+ T cells. Notably, we demonstrated allogeneic V\u03b42 T cells recognized and eliminated the HIV-latent CD4+ T cell reservoir following latency reversal. Our study provides evidence for developing an allogeneic \u03b3\u03b4 T cell therapy for HIV cure and warrants pre-clinical investigation in combination approaches.","17":"Cervical cancer (CC) remains the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women globally, with poor prognosis for metastatic and recurrent cases. Although genomic alterations have been extensively characterized, global proteogenomic landscape of the disease is largely under-explored. Here, we present the first genome-wide proteogenomic characterization of CC, analyzing 139 tumor-normal tissue pairs using whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics. We identified four distinct molecular subtypes with unique clinical outcomes: epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT, C1), proliferation (C2), immune response (C3), and epithelial differentiation (C4). A four-protein classifier (CDH13, TP53BP1, NNMT, HSPB1) was developed with strong prognostic and predictive value, particularly for immunotherapy response in subtype C3. Phosphoproteomic profiling uncovered subtype-specific kinase activity, identifying actionable therapeutic targets. Our findings further revealed previously uncharacterized somatic copy number alterations, extrachromosomal DNA landscape, and human-HPV fusion peptides, with implications for genetic heterogeneity and therapeutic targets. This study enhances the understanding of cervical cancer through deeper proteogenomic insights, and facilitates the development of personalized therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.","18":"Overall survival (OS) remains the gold-standard endpoint in oncology trials, while progression-free survival (PFS) is a widely used surrogate endpoint that captures tumor progression earlier. However, an increase in PFS has not necessarily led to an improvement in OS (Reck M, 2009). The recent CodeBreaK 200 trial, a randomized, open-label Phase 3 study evaluating sotorasib versus docetaxel as the control arm for previously treated metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations (Langen et al., 2023), demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS with sotorasib. However, there was no significant difference in OS between the sotorasib and docetaxel arms, suggesting that PFS may not fully capture the long-term impact of treatment. This discordance led the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) to recommend against granting full approval to sotorasib, despite the committee expressing optimism about the drug's potential efficacy (FDA ODAC meeting minutes, 10\/05\/2023). In this paper, we aim at identifying the factors that contribute to the discordance between the PFS and OS, especially those that lead to insignificant OS improvement in the presence of the significant benefits to PFS. More importantly, we propose guidance on how to adjust or plan for such factors during the study design in order to better demonstrate the treatment benefit to OS assuming the drug is efficacious. We proposed to use post-progression survival (PPS), which is defined as the difference between OS and PFS. We developed a flexible parametric simulation framework centered on PPS to quantify how various design factors impact OS given PFS is significant. Based on the simulated data under various scenarios, we investigated the impact of several factors, including censoring informativeness, crossover rates, subsequent therapy access, and improved treatment effect. Moreover, we revisited CodeBreaK200 design as a case study through extracting information from the CodeBreaK200 protocol and digitizing Kaplan Meier curves from published FDA documents. Our simulations reveal several factors that may lead to the discrepancy between the PFS and OS. First, allowing control-arm patients to crossover to the experimental therapy may lengthen their PPS, thereby shrinking the OS difference between the experimental treatment and control arm. Secondly, permitting both arms to access subsequent treatments similarly narrows the PPS difference. Even a stronger treatment effect that extends PPS in both arms further obscures the OS advantage of the experimental treatment arm. Finally, informative censoring (e.g., due to unbalanced early dropout between the experimental and control arms) may bias estimates of both PFS and OS. When the PFS benefit in the experimental arm is overestimated due to informative censoring, the apparent discordance between PFS and OS may be exaggerated. A larger sample size may help reduce the risk of observing PFS-OS discordance when a true OS benefit exists. In the case study using CodeBreaK200, the combination of informative censoring in the docetaxel arm and post-progression crossover may explain the disagreement between significant PFS benefit and insignificant OS improvement. We provide recommendations for oncology trial designs that consider factors such as informative censoring, crossover, and subsequent therapies, with the goal of preserving the interpretability of OS outcomes and more accurately reflecting the true treatment effect. An R Shiny application is available to facilitate implementation.","19":"No abstract available","20":"No abstract available","21":"When bladder cancer recurs after bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) for high-risk non-muscle-invasive disease, after trimodal therapy (TMT), or after other bladder-preserving therapy for muscle-invasive disease, patients face time-sensitive decisions that determine whether cure remains achievable. Treating physicians must guide these choices by balancing oncologic safety with quality of life, comorbidities, and patient preferences. We reviewed 2024-2025 guidelines from the American Urological Association\/Society of Urologic Oncology (AUA\/SUO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and European Association of Urology (EAU), while incorporating pivotal trials and recent drug approvals. Emphasis was placed on translating recommendations into practical decision-making for clinicians and patients. For post-BCG recurrence, early radical cystectomy (RC) offers the highest chance of cure for medically fit patients and is recommended throughout all three guidelines. When surgery is not possible or declined, bladder-sparing therapies, including four recently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, can be considered with strict surveillance. In post-TMT recurrence, RC is standard for invasive relapse, with bladder preservation reserved for select noninvasive cases. In both settings, optimal outcomes require timely workup, presentation of all viable options, and coordination of multidisciplinary input with a strong emphasis on close surveillance and follow-up. Management of bladder cancer recurrence is optimized when therapy aligns with patient goals while safeguarding oncologic outcomes. Regardless of the path chosen, early engagement of a multidisciplinary team and shared decision-making are essential to delivering the best possible care.","22":"Rural residence has been linked to disparities in cancer risk factors, access to care, and outcomes. In countries with universal healthcare such as Spain, the impact of rurality on head and neck cancer remains poorly characterized. We conducted a retrospective study of 1042 patients discussed at the Head and Neck Tumor Board of a tertiary hospital in M\u00e1laga, Spain (2019-2023). Demographic, clinical, and behavioral variables were collected. Rurality was defined according to Spanish legislation (population\u2009<\u200930,000 and density\u2009<\u2009100 inhabitants\/km<sup>2<\/sup>). Analyses included chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and logistic regression models. Rural patients had a higher prevalence of tobacco use (74.8% vs. 66.3%, p\u2009=\u20090.0074) and more severe smoking patterns, especially among men. Advanced-stage tumors were slightly more frequent in rural patients (64.5% vs. 60.6%) without reaching statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.6097). No associations were found between rurality and alcohol use, HPV status, or tumor site, while EBV positivity was more frequent in urban patients (p\u2009=\u20090.0235). Rural residence was associated with significantly higher tobacco use but not with advanced disease stage at diagnosis. These findings highlight rurality as a social determinant of health and support the need for targeted public health strategies to reduce cancer-related disparities in rural populations.","23":"No abstract available","24":"Clinical guidelines recommend initiating breast cancer treatment within 60\u00a0days of diagnosis. We examined the extent to which patient characteristics, healthcare access, and social vulnerability are associated with delay in surgical treatment among breast cancer patients in Arkansas. We used 2013-2019 data from the linked Arkansas Central Cancer Registry and the Arkansas All-Payer Claims Database (APCD) to identify female patients with breast cancer who received first-line surgical treatment (n\u2009=\u20096,279). Time to surgery (TTS) was defined as the interval between diagnosis and first surgical treatment and dichotomized at 60\u00a0days. The American Hospital Association Survey and AHRQ's Social Determinants of Health Database captured hospital- and community-level characteristics of healthcare access. We applied multivariable logistic regression models to assess associations between TTS and predictor variables. Overall, 12% of patients received surgery after 60\u00a0days of diagnosis. Non-Hispanic Black patients had 82% higher odds of surgical delay (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.46-2.29) compared to non-Hispanic White patients. Residing in counties with high social vulnerability index scores for housing\/transportation (aOR 1.38; 95% CI 1.06-1.81) was associated with greater odds of delay, whereas higher county-level rates of routine doctor visits (aOR 0.89; 95% CI 0.82-0.97) were associated with lower odds of delays. Disparities in delay in breast cancer surgery persist across race, healthcare access, and community-level vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for strengthened support services and improved continuity of care among vulnerable populations.","25":"Pediatric sarcomas representing a\u00a0rare, heterogenous group of highly malignant tumors. Due to their aggressiveness and complex anatomy during growth, precise imaging is essential for prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using specific pediatric protocols (small field of view [FOV], thin slices), is the gold standard for local staging. Ultrasound is pivotal for primary diagnosis and biopsy planning, while low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) is used to assess pulmonary metastases. Diffusion-weighted MRI and positron-emission tomography (PET)\/MRI represents a\u00a0low-radiation and highly efficient alternative to PET\/CT for whole-body staging, especially for long-term aftercare. Imaging enables precise delineation of neurovascular structures and growth plates, forming the basis for limb-sparing surgical procedures. However, differentiating between vital residual tumor, recurrence, and posttherapeutic changes (scars, edema) remains challenging. The consistent application of standardized study protocols and the interdisciplinary integration of radiology, oncology, and surgery are crucial for the success of modern therapeutic concepts.","26":"This work aims to create and validate a comprehensive set of test cases and 3D reference dosimetric datasets for model-based dose calculation algorithms (MBDCAs) in permanent implant prostate brachytherapy. These test cases address the limits of the standard TG-43 formalism towards improving dose evaluations in prostate cancer treatment, in accordance with the recommendations of the joint Task Group 186 of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), and the Australasian Brachytherapy Group (ABG). Six test scenarios using the I-125 OncoSeed 6711 were simulated with three Monte Carlo codes: EGSnrc application egs_brachy with eb_gui, MCNP with BrachyGuide, and PenRed. The test cases range from basic, e.g., single seed in water, to more complex configurations, e.g., 58 seeds in a virtual patient model for prostate treatment. The virtual model was developed from anonymized CT-based images, representing a real patient with and without calcifications. Dose comparisons were performed using both local and global metrics, with eb_gui as the reference for validation. For all test cases, the local agreement of Monte Carlo codes was within \u223c3.0% and the global agreement was 0.01%. The dataset, including Monte Carlo input files and other required information, is available online at https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5281\/zenodo.15282647. The developed test cases provide an essential resource for the development, validation, and commissioning of MBDCAs. They have the potential to improve dosimetric accuracy in complex prostate implants while also providing a platform for future brachytherapy research.","27":"En bloc spondylectomies are essential for controlling malignant spinal tumors, but existing classification systems are often complex and impractical. This study introduces the Column, Line-of-Sight, Margins, Ring (CLiMR) framework, a novel system simplifying and standardizing en bloc spondylectomy planning and classification. A retrospective review of patients who underwent single- or multistage en bloc spinal tumor resections was conducted at a single academic center (October 2019-December 2024). The CLiMR framework assigns scores to 4 components: Column (osteotomies\/diskectomies for tumor release), Line-of-Sight (approach for circumferential access), Margin (adjacent structures sacrificed), and Ring (size of the vertebral ring window for safe delivery of neural tissue). Scores were applied using operative notes and imaging. Column scores ranged from 0.5 to 4.5. Of the patients included, 40.9% underwent sagittal split osteotomies, 22.7% radical diskectomies, 18.2% horizontal osteotomies, and the remaining 18.2% combinations of previous osteotomies . A posterior-only approach (Line-of-Sight score = 1) was used in 45.4% of cases, whereas 45.4% required a multistage approach (score = 2). Margin scores reflected increasing morbidity: 31.8% (n = 7) involving chest wall\/pleura resection (grade 3), 40.9% (n = 9) requiring eloquent nerve sacrifice (grade 6), and 9.1% (n = 2) necessitating limb sacrifice (grade 7). The majority (86.4%, n = 19) of ring scores were grade 1, requiring laminectomies\/facetectomies. The mean CLiMR score was 9.36 \u00b1 2.43, with higher scores correlating with longer hospital stays (R = 0.64, P = .0012), longer case durations (R = 0.61, P = .0023), and increased blood loss (R = 0.40, P = .067). Patients with local recurrence, positive margins, or complications trended toward greater CLiMR scores. The CLiMR framework provides a novel, user-friendly method for planning and communicating en bloc spondylectomies. By addressing technical complexities and morbidity, CLiMR enables standardized assessment, facilitates surgical decision-making, and supports future research. This study demonstrates feasibility and lays the foundation for future validation studies.","28":"Current clinical decision-making is hindered by the absence of predictive preclinical models that faithfully bridge molecular diversity to patient outcomes. Here, we apply the principle of abstraction-deriving essential features from human tissues to build next-generation new approach methodologies (NAMs) that transform patient-derived organoids (PDOs) into predictive vehicles for Crohn's disease (CD). From our living biobank of adult stem cell-derived colonic PDOs, we previously defined two molecular CD subtypes: Immune-Deficient Infectious CD (<i>IDICD<\/i>) and Stress and Senescence-Induced Fibrostenotic CD (<i>S2FCD<\/i>), each defined by unique genomic, transcriptomic, and functional profiles with matched therapeutic vulnerabilities. In this study, we prospectively anchored PDO-derived molecular phenotypes to real-world clinical outcomes, revealing that <i>S2FCD<\/i> maps to baseline and progressive colonic disease activity, whereas <i>IDICD<\/i> tracks with prior ileocecal surgery, penetrating disease behavior, as well as baseline and progressive ileal disease activity. By abstracting NAMs from human tissues and cycling insights between small-'n' organoids and Phase 3-sized datasets, this framework recasts PDOs as dynamic, predictive platforms that capture the past, present, and future of disease behavior. Beyond oncology, this work establishes PDOs as vehicles for prospective clinical trial-like studies in inflammatory diseases and highlights colonic immune dysfunction as a potential driver of ileal CD.","29":"Canine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires further molecular characterization to identify diagnostic and therapeutic targets, and to establish whether dogs with this condition can model the human disease. Accordingly, we aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in canine HCC and evaluate cross-species transcriptomic dysregulation in canine and human HCC. Liver tissue samples from three dogs with HCC and three healthy dogs were subjected to next-generation sequencing, followed by RT-qPCR validation. Identified DEGs were then targeted in bioinformatics analyses (pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction network, and hub gene analyses) for molecular characterization and comparison with human HCC datasets. We identified 975 DEGs (upregulated: 604; and downregulated: 371). Extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, cell adhesion molecule, PI3K\/Akt signaling, and cytokine\/chemokine-related pathways were enriched. C1R, APOC3, C1QA, APOA1, C1QB, ACTG1, C1QC, CRP, ANXA5, and ANXA2 were identified as hub genes. Canine and human HCCs share 118 DEGs, highlighting conserved alterations in metabolic pathways, PI3K-Akt signaling, focal adhesion, and PPAR signaling pathways. Based on human HCC data, SPP1, NQO1, RRM2, APOA1, APOC3, ALDOB, and IGF1 were identified as prognosticators indicating poor overall survival. This study presents the first cross-species transcriptomic analysis of canine HCC, revealing significant molecular resemblances to human HCC, indicating it may be a promising comparative model for studying tumor biology, drug responses, and novel therapeutic interventions.","30":"Molecular profiling guides cancer treatment, by identifying actionable genomic alterations. The IMPRESS-Norway trial (NCT04817956) is a nation-wide precision medicine trial evaluating the efficacy of approved cancer drugs on a novel indication in patients with advanced cancers harbouring potentially actionable alterations. Trametinib, a selective MEK1\/2 inhibitor targeting the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, is approved for BRAF V600 mutant melanoma but may also show activity in tumours with other alterations. This sub-study aimed to assess the efficacy of trametinib monotherapy across tumour types with alterations activating the MAPK signalling pathway. Patient\/material and methods: In the IMPRESS-Norway trial patients are screened with the TruSight Oncology 500 panel or circulating tumour DNA profiling. Eligible patients are offered biomarker matched targeted therapies. In this subgroup analysis, we identified patients treated with trametinib monotherapy. Primary endpoints were disease control rate (DCR) after 16 weeks and safety. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). DCR after 16 weeks of treatment was 39% in 52 response evaluable patients, with four patients (8%) experiencing partial response, and 16 (31%) stable disease. Responses were seen in tumours harbouring BRAF fusions, GNA11, GNAQ, KRAS, NF1, and NRAS alterations, most frequently in low-grade serous ovarian cancer, central nervous system tumours, and uveal melanoma. Forty-eight percent of patients experienced treatment-related adverse events, including two treatment related deaths. Median PFS and OS were 4 and 9 months, respectively. Trametinib monotherapy achieved a 39% DCR in patients lacking standard options, supporting further studies to confirm efficacy and identify predictive biomarkers for treatment response.","31":"Up to one-third of patients treated with primary radiotherapy (RT) for prostate cancer (PCa) experience biochemical failure (BCF). In selected cases, re-irradiation represents a salvage option. PSMA PET\/CT is a valuable tool for detecting intraprostatic recurrence and guiding re-treatment planning. Although visual scoring systems such as the PRIMARY score (PS) have been proposed, none are currently validated for this setting. This pilot study investigates the role of a visual classification system in optimizing salvage re-irradiation strategies. We retrospectively analysed patients with histologically confirmed PCa who underwent re-irradiation for intraprostatic recurrence, following PSMA PET\/CT between 2021 and 2024. Only patients without extra-prostatic disease were included. Clinical, imaging, and treatment data were collected. Re-irradiation was delivered using image-guided volumetric modulated arc therapy. Outcomes included BCF and toxicity (CTCAE v5). Thirteen patients (median age: 76 years) were included. The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group at diagnosis was 1-2 in ten patients and \u2265\u20094 in three. Median PSA at diagnosis and at re-irradiation was 9.43 and 2.22 ng\/mL, respectively. PSMA PET\/CT showed uptake in all cases (focal: 8, diffuse: 4, mixed: 1); PS was \u2265\u20094 in eight patients. Re-irradiation was delivered after a mean interval of 8.1 years, with a median dose of 30\u00a0Gy in 5 fractions. PET\/CT guided target delineation in 11 cases. After 16 months of median follow-up, four patients had BCF, and two experienced mild toxicity (Grade 1). These preliminary findings highlight the limitations of visual interpretation alone; further optimization by Nuclear Medicine and Radiation Oncology specialists is needed to enhance BCF and limit local toxicities.","32":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized oncology but trigger unique immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While intestinal toxicities like enterocolitis are frequent, serious upper gastrointestinal (UGI) involvement, such as isolated severe ulcerative gastritis, remains rare. We report the case of a 72-year-old female with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma who developed Grade 3 ulcerative gastritis after eight months of pembrolizumab therapy. The patient presented with a four-week history of epigastric pain, vomiting, and an 8-kg weight loss, complicated by severe iron-deficiency anemia. Endoscopy revealed extensive ulcerative pangastritis with fibrin-covered ulcers. Histopathology confirmed chronic active gastritis with neutrophilic microabscesses and high rates of glandular apoptosis, a hallmark of ICI-induced injury, while excluding infectious etiologies. Following pembrolizumab discontinuation and high-dose corticosteroid therapy, the patient achieved clinical remission, with follow-up endoscopy at eight weeks demonstrating significant mucosal healing. This case emphasizes the need for high clinical suspicion and early endoscopy in patients on immunotherapy with persistent UGI symptoms, as these toxicities often present later than intestinal events and can significantly mimic disease progression.","33":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract and represent a paradigm of precision oncology in which histopathology and molecular profiling directly inform diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic strategy. Arising from the interstitial cells of Cajal or their precursors, GISTs display a wide morphological spectrum, including spindle cell, epithelioid, mixed, and rare histologic variants, often requiring immunohistochemical confirmation with KIT (CD117), DOG1, and CD34. Molecular characterization reveals a limited but clinically decisive range of driver mutations, most commonly in KIT and PDGFRA, with additional subsets involving SDH deficiency, NF1 alterations, and rare mutations such as BRAF, KRAS, or NTRK fusions. These molecular signatures underpin distinct biological behaviors, prognostic categories, and therapeutic sensitivities. Risk stratification incorporates tumor size, mitotic rate, anatomical location, and tumor rupture to predict recurrence and guide adjuvant therapy decisions. Targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have transformed GIST management, with imatinib as the foundational first-line therapy and subsequent agents, sunitinib, regorafenib, avapritinib, and ripretinib, addressing primary or secondary resistance driven by diverse mutational patterns. Nevertheless, challenges persist, including imatinib-resistant PDGFRA D842V mutations, SDH-deficient tumors lacking actionable kinase alterations, and the emergence of polyclonal secondary resistance due to heterogeneous KIT adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding pocket or activation loop mutations. Emerging therapeutic directions include next-generation kinase inhibitors, heat shock protein inhibitors, immunotherapy, metabolic and epigenetic targeting, and biomarker-driven individualized treatment strategies. This review synthesizes contemporary advances in the histopathological, molecular, and therapeutic landscape of GISTs, emphasizing an integrated diagnostic approach and highlighting ongoing efforts to overcome therapeutic resistance and optimize personalized care.","34":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are characterized by their covalently closed structure, remarkable stability, and precise spatiotemporal regulation, evolving from once-overlooked transcriptional byproducts to pivotal molecular regulators. In addition to their well-established function as microRNA sponges, circRNAs serve as protein scaffolds, transcriptional modulators, and even templates for functional peptide synthesis. This review synthesizes recent breakthroughs across the entire circRNA life cycle, encompassing biogenesis, degradation, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and extracellular vesicle-mediated secretion, while systematically analyzing their multifaceted involvement in tumorigenesis, immune evasion, metastatic dissemination, programmed cell death, and tumor-microbiome crosstalk. We highlight their exceptional potential as liquid biopsy biomarkers and critically assess translational applications in circRNA-based vaccines, targeted delivery platforms, and engineered cell therapies like CAR-T. Emerging artificial intelligence approaches that accelerate circRNA discovery, functional characterization, and therapeutic design are also discussed. Addressing current challenges in standardization and delivery methodologies, we propose future directions for incorporating circRNAs and their encoded proteins into precision oncology and next-generation immunotherapies. Together, these advances position circRNAs as a transformative paradigm with the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnostics, targeted therapeutics, and RNA vaccine development.","35":"This Industry Update covers the period from 1 October through to 31 October 2025 and is based on information sourced from company press releases, scientific literature, patents, and various news websites.","36":"This study evaluated the feasibility and surgical outcomes of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) for retroperitoneal sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), specifically targeting obese and morbidly obese patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer (EC). Pathohistological evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of either Grade I or II endometrioid EC in all participants. In total, 31 patients participated in this study. The median age was 56 [43-75] years and the median BMI was 34 [30-54] kg\/m2. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging utilizing ICG was implemented in 17 cases (54.8%), while methylene blue dye was used in 14 cases (45.2%). A median, 4 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were excised per patient, with numbers ranging from 1 to 7. The overall SLN detection rate was 90.3%, with unilateral detection in 9.7% of patients and bilateral detection in 80.6%. During the surgery, two complications occurred, and an additional two developed afterward. In 3.2% of cases, it was required to switch to a conventional laparoscopic procedure. Lymphatic metastases were identified in 3 patients (9.7%). The median hospital stay was 2 days. vNOTES can be a viable alternative to retroperitoneal SLNB, providing distinct benefits, especially for obese and morbidly obese patients with EC.","37":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), although revolutionary in the field of oncology, have been associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that affect nearly every organ of the body. Many common AEs are well documented, but in this review, we highlight some rare irAEs that are mostly limited to reports of observational or case studies. Although these irAEs can be difficult to associate with ICI use due to their scarcity and often delayed onset, understanding and characterizing these rare irAEs is crucial to refining treatment strategies and improving outcomes for patients with cancer receiving ICIs. This review covers the rare irAEs affecting various organ systems, including cardiac, dermatological, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematological, hepatobiliary, neurological, ocular, pancreatic, renal, and rheumatological. Information regarding irAEs compiled in this review are largely derived from case reports and case series and includes discussion surrounding proposed etiology, phenotype, and treatment of AEs. Rare irAEs can occur in nearly all organ systems. Although it is difficult to attribute causation of an AE to ICIs, it is important for clinicians to be aware of possible AEs to rapidly diagnose and treat potential symptoms. Further research should focus on strategies to improve recognition of rare irAEs.","38":"Health care organizations have failed to replicate the performance of high-reliability organizations (HROs), systems that operate nearly error-free despite inherently complex, interdependent, and time-pressured environments. We sought to better understand conditions that facilitate and inhibit HRO in health care by expanding the conceptualization of who contributes to high reliability to include patients. We also examine how cancer care teams and patients describe jointly enacting (or failing to enact) each of the five HRO principles. We conducted a qualitative field study, interviewing 25 oncology clinicians from diverse roles (e.g., surgery, nursing, dentistry) (17 interviews) and eight cancer patients. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and deductively coded for barriers and facilitators to the five HRO principles. We identified conditions that supported and hindered high-reliability cancer care. HRO principles commonly overlapped to support or hinder system resilience. A common barrier was insufficient processes to proactively identify clinical deterioration. Patients and their family caregiver(s) were primarily responsible for monitoring their health and identifying and communicating any signs of deterioration. Cancer patients and caregivers were routinely engaged as team members, and patients developed expertise throughout treatment, thereby supporting system safety. These findings expand the conceptualization of how high reliability is produced. Specifically, we highlight the key role that patients play in preventing errors and monitoring care. Our findings expand our understanding of how HRO principles interact to promote cancer care system safety and elucidate how patients and their family caregivers contribute to system resilience. This work can inform the redesign of care processes to optimize patient safety.","39":"The paramount challenge in precision oncology lies in further improving quality of life and response rates for individual patients. Efforts toward these goals are steadily expanding the scope of clinical implementation, despite ongoing challenges such as standardization, cost-effectiveness, and data harmonization. Building upon this maturing foundation, generative AI-which has evolved dramatically in recent years-is particularly valuable at this stage of advancing efficiency and adoption as an auxiliary technology linking literature, guidelines, trial protocols, and patient data. Specifically, through mutation interpretation, trial eligibility matching, and tumor board support, it is expected to contribute to advancing standardization, improving cost-effectiveness, accelerating data harmonization, and further accelerating human-centered decision-making. Accordingly, this review surveys the development history of generative AI and its current healthcare applications, organizing its implementation potential for precision oncology along three axes: (1) generative AI-based interpretation of genetic mutations and estimation of their pathological significance; (2) generative AI-driven verification of clinical trial eligibility; and (3) multimodal foundation models for imaging and pathology that compute \"tumor phenotypes\" using real-world data, contributing to report drafting and molecular surrogate estimation. In response, we propose a strategy centered on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows, encompassing data preparation based on OMOP, mCODE, and FHIR; multicenter prospective evaluation; auditable logs and governance aligned with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and the EU AI Act; and a synthetic data strategy including differential privacy. Ultimately, this approach validates value through real-world outcomes and charts a path toward \"learning oncology,\" accelerating patient-centered decision-making and clinical trial development.","40":"No abstract available","41":"Central venous access devices (CVADs) are essential in pediatric oncology but frequently associated with infections, thromboses, and dysfunction. Although structured surveillance may reduce complications, implementation is limited by fragmented documentation across clinical systems. We conducted a mixed-methods study combining a two-stage interdisciplinary electronic Delphi process with retrospective cohort analysis. Pediatric oncology patients diagnosed between 2020 and 2021 who received a CVAD at our university hospital were included. Data were manually extracted from three hospital information systems. Only the first CVAD per patient was analyzed (n\u2009=\u2009112). Of 219 diagnosed patients, 112 met inclusion criteria, accounting for 126 CVADs. The eDelphi panel identified 30 core surveillance parameters, 23 retrievable from routine records. Complications occurred in 23.2%, most commonly infections leading to premature removal. Standardized electronic CVAD documentation could enhance surveillance, improve patient safety, and reduce manual data collection efforts.","42":"Carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) spinal implants lessen MRI artifacts compared with titanium, potentially improving surveillance and radiotherapy planning; pediatric experience remains limited. We sought to demonstrate feasibility and imaging\/radiotherapy workflow advantages in children with spinal tumors. An 11-year-old boy with retroclival chordoma underwent occipitocervical fusion (occiput-C5) using CFR-PEEK lateral mass screws with conventional occipital hardware; postoperative MRI sharply delineated the operative bed and enabled proton planning; he is disease-free at 6\u00a0months. A 15-year-old boy with recurrent L2-L3 Ewing sarcoma underwent laminectomy with facetectomy, gross-total resection, and L2-L3 fusion using CFR-PEEK pedicle screws; postoperative imaging showed minimal artifact and facilitated proton planning; he is disease-free at 11\u00a0months. Across both cases, radiolucency and markedly reduced artifact improved visualization of the tumor bed and thecal sac, supporting accurate target definition for proton therapy without compromising construct stability; pediatric constraints (e.g., lack of CFR-PEEK occipital components) were manageable with hybrid hardware. CFR-PEEK appears to be a practical and promising option for pediatric spinal oncology when long-term MRI surveillance and adjuvant radiotherapy are anticipated. Our experience, alongside a focused literature review, supports selective use and motivates prospective pediatric studies to confirm imaging, radiotherapy, and durability benefits.","43":"Involvement of the bone marrow by metastases from\u00a0solid tumors or multiple myeloma (MM) is a critical challenge in oncologic imaging. Lesion detection and staging, as well as accurate assessment of treatment response, disease recurrence, and complications, are key to optimal patient management. This article provides recommendations for performing and interpreting bone marrow MRI in cancer patients. MRI should be the primary imaging modality for patients suspected of having skeletal bone metastases or MM, and should replace radiography, bone scintigraphy, and CT for these indications. Protocols must be tailored to the clinical context and to each specific cancer. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is preferred for a comprehensive assessment, while axial skeleton MRI (AS-MRI) is a fast and reliable alternative for targeted or follow-up evaluations. We recommend standardized protocols that incorporate anatomical sequences (preferably fast spin echo T2 Dixon) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Quantitative biomarkers, e.g., apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fat fraction (FF), should be implemented to improve diagnostic accuracy and evaluate treatment response. Radiologists must be familiar with the typical patterns of bone marrow replacement by cancer cells, response assessment principles, and common imaging pitfalls. Every medical imaging facility should offer optimal bone marrow MRI and implement these recommendations using available MRI systems and existing disease-oriented guidelines. This ESR Essentials illustrates when, how, and why to perform bone marrow MRI to improve diagnostic precision and oncologic care across a broad range of indications. KEY POINTS: Prefer MRI of the bone marrow over radiographs, bone scintigraphy, or CT for suspected bone metastases of solid cancers and for myeloma staging. Use MRI for diagnosis of bone involvement, disease staging, assessment of lesion response to treatment, detection of recurrence, and assessment of osseous complications. Tailor MRI protocol to cancer type following existing guidelines, targeting either the axial skeleton or the \"whole body,\" and using a panel of sequences with fat-sensitive, fast spin echo T2 Dixon and diffusion-weighted sequences as the fundamental components.","44":"Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) with double reads and adjudication is crucial in imaging-based clinical trials to ensure quality data. However, discrepancies in double reading can affect trial outcomes, particularly in assessing disease progression in phase 3 oncology studies using RECIST 1.1 criteria. This study examined discordance in the date of progressive disease (DoPD) across RECIST components: target lesion (TL), non-target lesion (nTL), new lesion (NL), exploring its impact on survival curves and whether discrepancies stem from timing differences or true\/false PD detection. We retrospectively analyzed data from five clinical trials using BICR with double reads plus adjudication, involving 1932 lung cancer patients on immunotherapy or targeted therapy. RECIST components were examined to assess DoPD concordance, discrepancies, adjudicator acceptance, detection timing, and impact on survival curves. Readers showed a 39.3% discordance rate in DoPD assessments, with agreement on 17.3% of DoPD cases and 43.4% of non-PD cases. In 54.2% of concordant cases, multiple RECIST components contributed to PD. Discordance was primarily caused by NL (41.4%), sum of TL diameter increase (33.3%), nTL (11.8%), or multiple components (13.4%). In 49.2% of discrepant cases, PD was reported late, usually within one treatment cycle (79.8%). 62.5% of disputed PD cases were accepted by adjudication. Different RECIST components vary in their likelihood of causing discordance and being accepted or refuted by adjudicators. NL detection is key for identifying progression but also the main source of disagreement. Using multiple RECIST components enhances the reliability of PD assessment. Question How does discordance across RECIST components-especially new lesion detection-influence progression assessment timing and potentially alter survival outcomes in oncology clinical trials? Findings Reader disagreement on progression dates is common, driven mainly by new lesion detection; incorporating multiple RECIST components increases alignment and strengthens PD determination reliability. Clinical relevance Imaging endpoints guide cancer treatment decisions. RECIST 1.1 is the standard, inter-reader variability can undermine PFS accuracy. By evaluating RECIST component reliability, this work aims to improve trial precision, enabling faster, more confident decisions that ultimately benefit patients.","45":"Classification of tumors in neuro-oncology today relies on molecular patterns (mostly DNA methylation) and their machine learning-supported interpretation. Understanding the process of algorithmic interpretation is essential for safe application in clinical routine. This is paradigmatically true for the most common primary intracranial tumor in adults, meningioma. Here, by applying multiomic profiling and multiple lines of orthogonal computational evaluation in multiple independent datasets, we found that not only tumor cell characteristics but also incremental changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have impact on epigenetic meningioma classification and clinical outcome. Besides revealing the decisive role of non-neoplastic cells in the CNS methylation classifier, this challenges the model of distinct meningioma subgroups toward a TME-determined risk continuum. This refines current controversies in molecular meningioma subtyping. In addition, we apply these learnings to devise and validate a simple diagnostic approach for increased clinical prediction accuracy based on immunohistochemistry, which is also applicable in resource-limited settings.","46":"Ferroptosis represents an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, distinguished by the accumulation of lipid peroxides. This process holds significant implications for tumor progression and resistance to therapeutic interventions. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which facilitate interactions between cells and between cells and the extracellular matrix, have emerged as pivotal regulators of ferroptosis sensitivity within the cancerous milieu. Accumulating evidence underscores the capacity of CAMs to modulate key ferroptotic pathways. This includes the system Xc<sup>-<\/sup>\/GSH\/GPX4 antioxidant axis and iron metabolism through endocytic uptake mechanisms. Depending on the cellular context, CAMs can either promote or suppress ferroptosis. This review offers a systematic summary of the roles played by major CAM families-namely, the immunoglobulin superfamily, cadherins, and integrins-in the regulation of ferroptosis. Such regulation is achieved through diverse mechanisms, including signal transduction, lipid peroxidation, and iron homeostasis. Furthermore, we delve into the therapeutic potential of targeting CAMs, either as standalone treatments or in conjunction with ferroptosis inducers, as a novel and promising strategy for cancer management. These insights not only enhance our comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms governing ferroptosis mediated by CAMs but also pave the way for innovative combination therapies in the field of oncology.","47":"This study aims to provide an integrated, probability-based comparison of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC), laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC), and open radical cystectomy (ORC) in Japan by jointly evaluating clinical and economic outcomes using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).\u00a0Clinical and economic outcomes were extracted from large nationwide studies based on the National Clinical Database and the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in Japan, including estimated blood loss, grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 complications, lymph node count, in-hospital fee, length of stay, and transfusion rates. Outcome uncertainty was propagated using parametric bootstrap resampling with 50,000 iterations, and criterion-specific values were normalized to a common 0-1 scale within each iteration. Six prespecified weighting scenarios (balanced, safety-focused, perioperative-focused, oncology-focused, cost-focused, and efficiency-focused) produced overall scores, rank probabilities, and pairwise net advantages. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results.\u00a0Across all weighting scenarios, both minimally invasive approaches outperformed ORC, with RARC consistently achieving the highest expected MCDA scores and rank probabilities. The advantage of RARC over LRC remained evident across scenarios, including cost-focused analyses, but was attenuated under safety-focused weighting. Sensitivity analyses did not materially alter the overall ranking patterns.\u00a0Using MCDA to integrate heterogeneous clinical and economic outcomes from Japanese nationwide data, RARC most frequently emerged as the preferred surgical approach over LRC and ORC. This transparent and reproducible framework supports informed clinical decision-making and policy discussions regarding the role of RARC in Japan.","48":"Exercise has the potential to improve and maintain physical function, alleviate symptoms, improve quality of life, and influence prognosis in patients with advanced lung cancer. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) primarily examined the impact of exercise on physical function, with a focus on cardiorespiratory fitness. A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CINAHL was conducted from inception to June 28, 2024. Eligible RCTs examined exercise interventions in patients with advanced lung cancer, evaluating physical function, symptoms, quality of life, and prognosis. Subgroup analyses were performed based on measurement sites and items. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for quantitative outcomes, and a random-effects model was used for data pooling. Nine RCTs (from 4,262 retrieved articles) were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that patients who participated in exercise interventions had greater improvements in VO<sub>2<\/sub>peak (SMD 0.38; p\u2009=\u20090.01), muscle strength, and physical activity than those in the control group. Additionally, exercise was associated with greater reductions in fatigue and improvements in quality of life. Since only one study reported on prognosis, a meta-analysis could not be performed for this outcome. We conclude that exercise plays a crucial role in improving cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, quality of life, and fatigue in patients with advanced lung cancer, highlighting the importance of incorporating exercise into their cancer care. However, future studies, including head-to-head comparative trials, are required to clarify the effects of different exercise types and their impact on prognosis. PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42024575482.","49":"Psycho-oncological support is crucial for palliative cancer patients and their families, helping them to cope with psychosocial distress. Currently, this support is most often provided in inpatient settings or during regular outpatient appointments. A decline in general health and the cessation of tumour-specific treatment often lead to an abrupt end of the established therapeutic relationship, creating a gap in care precisely when patients and their families face a particularly burdensome situation. Specialist palliative home care (SPHC) offers comprehensive physical and psychosocial support within a home-based environment. This project aims to investigate whether pre-existing psycho-oncological care can be continued and integrated into home care with the help of SPHC logistics, focusing on feasibility and implementation. Therefore, psycho-oncologists who typically provide care for patients in a clinical setting will perform home visits for palliative cancer patients. Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews with patients, their relatives, psycho-oncologists, and SPHC staff to assess the feasibility of providing home-based psycho-oncological care. The interviews will explore factors such as the acceptability, satisfaction, and practicability of the intervention, while also identifying key facilitators and barriers to successful implementation. By identifying facilitating and hindering factors, this study aims to determine how home-based psycho-oncological care can be implemented successfully using SPHC infrastructure. The findings can contribute to advancing research on appropriate psycho-oncological care for palliative patients in their homes and to establishing corresponding care structures. The study was registered at German Clinical Trials Register, ID: DRKS00034896.","50":"Patients with cancer often experience weight loss, which contributes to a decreased quality of life and signals a poor prognosis. The objective of this retrospective study is to investigate whether the self-reported race\/ethnicity of patients undergoing palliative care is associated with weight loss. The charts of 1,253 patients with advanced lung cancer who had a Palliative Medicine consultation, during 2022, were identified and random sample of 94 Asian, 94 Black, 87 Hispanic and 91 non-Hispanic-White patients were selected for evaluation. Patient demographics, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, body mass index (BMI), weight history, symptom burden measured by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), cancer treatments provided (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or immunotherapy), prescription of appetite stimulants [megestrol acetate, steroids, olanzapine, cannabinoids, metoclopramide, or mirtazapine), and nutritional laboratory markers (albumin, protein level, neutrophile-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)] were collected. Univariate and multivariable regression linear analysis were performed to explore whether a patient's self-identified race\/ethnicity was an independent predictor of weight loss. Among the different self-identified racial\/ethnic groups of patients, no significant differences in age, gender, appetite stimulants received, and NLR were noted. The Asian and Hispanic cohort had significantly lower weight and BMI at first encounter, Palliative Medicine consultation, and final recorded visit compared to all other groups (P<0.01). The median time from the first encounter to the last recorded weight was 6.7 months for the whole cohort. Asian patients had significantly less total weight loss (8.2 kg) compared to Black (13.4 kg), Hispanic (9.1 kg), and non-Hispanic White (10.2 kg) patients (P=0.04); but all four groups experienced similar proportion of weight loss (%) (12.8 vs. 14.9 vs. 12.2 vs. 12.9; P=0.79), respectively. Asian patients had a higher median household income (P<0.001), less likely to live alone (P=0.02), and more likely to be married or have a significant other (P<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the weight at first encounter but not race\/ethnicity was the only independent predictor of percentage weight loss. In patients with advanced lung cancer, BMI and total weight loss but not percentage change in weight was significantly associated with self-identified race\/ethnicity at the time of Palliative Medicine consultation. On multivariate analysis, the percentage loss in weight was significantly influenced by the weight at first encounter but not race\/ethnicity. Racial\/ethnic variations in BMI but not percentage weight loss should be accounted for when diagnosing cancer cachexia and more research is needed.","51":"Despite proven benefit of outpatient specialty palliative care on symptom burden, quality-of-life, and survival, only 20-30% of eligible patients with gynecologic cancers receive a referral, even in high-resource health systems. Socioeconomically disadvantaged and culturally marginalized populations face inequitable access to specialty palliative care. However, the relationships between social determinants of health (SDOH) and palliative care utilization remain understudied. We evaluated rates of outpatient specialty palliative care referral and assessed disparities associated with SDOH. A single institution retrospective cohort quality improvement study evaluated gynecologic oncology patients receiving care in Kansas City, Kansas (midwestern United States) who met American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) criteria for referral to outpatient specialty palliative care from 2019-2022. Eligible patients were stratified based on whether or not they were referred to an outpatient specialty palliative care provider. Groups were compared based on clinical factors [age, cancer site, stage, primary versus recurrent disease status, body mass index (BMI)], and SDOH (race, ethnicity, primary language, insurance status, having a primary care provider (PCP), distance from the hospital, rurality, and Area Deprivation Index (ADI). Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were performed, and odds ratios were calculated. During the study period, 432 gynecologic oncology patients were eligible for referral to outpatient specialty palliative care, of which 191 (44%) were referred and 146 (34%) ultimately saw a palliative care provider. Patients who received a palliative care referral more frequently had recurrent disease and lower BMI. Patients were referred to a palliative care provider less commonly if they lived in a rural or disadvantaged (>70th percentile ADI) county, lived further from a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated cancer center, or if they were established with a PCP. On multivariable logistic regression evaluating rurality, distance, deprivation, and primary care access, only rurality and primary care access remained significant. Rural patients were less likely to be referred to a palliative care provider [odds ratio (OR) 0.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-0.54, P<0.001], and patients without a PCP were more likely to be referred to palliative care provider (OR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-2.95, P=0.01). Gynecologic cancer patients were less commonly referred to outpatient specialty palliative care if living in a distant, rural or disadvantaged county or if established with primary care. For our patient population, rurality and access to primary care were the primary SDOH driving referral to palliative care. This analysis demonstrates the importance of understanding effects of SDOH to tailor quality improvement interventions to prioritize the most pressing needs of a given patient population in a context-dependent manner.","52":"Glutathione (GSH), the most abundant cellular non-protein thiol and a central antioxidant, plays essential roles in regulating redox homeostasis, signal transduction, and detoxification processes. Altered GSH levels are closely associated with various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders, and liver injury. Notably, tumor tissues exhibit markedly elevated GSH concentrations (up to 4-10 times higher than in normal cells), where it promotes tumor proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance by sustaining a reduced microenvironment, these characteristics make GSH an important biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology. We developed a novel \"switch-on\" near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence nanoprobe, Ag<sub>2<\/sub>S-CH@Cu-TCPP, for the highly sensitive and selective detection and imaging of GSH. The nanoprobe was constructed by conjugating histidine-rich CH peptides to carboxyl-capped Ag<sub>2<\/sub>S quantum dots (Ag<sub>2<\/sub>S QDs), which were then self-assembled onto two-dimensional Cu-TCPP metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets via coordination between Cu<sup>2+<\/sup> and imidazole groups. In this design, Cu-TCPP acts as an efficient quencher for the Ag<sub>2<\/sub>S-CH fluorescence via a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism. Upon encountering GSH, the reduction of Cu<sup>2+<\/sup> to Cu\u00a0<sup>+<\/sup>\u00a0disrupts the FRET process, leading to the recovery of the NIR fluorescence signal. This nanoprobe demonstrated a low detection limit of 5.33\u00a0\u03bcM and a wide linear range from 0.625 to 10\u00a0mM for GSH quantification, with excellent selectivity, high reproducibility, and favorable biocompatibility. We successfully applied the platform for monitoring intracellular GSH levels and distinguishing between cancer cells and normal cells based on their differential GSH expression. The \"switch-on\" probe demonstrates excellent biocompatibility and is applicable for cellular imaging. It enables discrimination between normal and cancer cells while supporting semi-quantitative analysis of both endogenous and exogenous GSH. This work provides a novel and reliable strategy for tumor diagnosis and advanced investigations into GSH-related biological processes.","53":"Genetic abnormalities are a cornerstone for prognostic assessment in multiple myeloma (MM) and form the basis of contemporary risk-stratification systems. In routine clinical practice, cytogenetic karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and next-generation sequencing should be performed in a standardized manner to identify high-risk patients and guide individualized therapy. With recent advances in genomic technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing and single-cell sequencing, our understanding of clonal evolution and genetic heterogeneity in MM has deepened. Meanwhile, the use of triplet and quadruplet combination regimens has altered the prognostic impact of certain genetic lesions, highlighting the need to update the existing risk frameworks. To standardize genetic testing for MM in China, the Multiple Myeloma Expert Committee of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) and Myeloma & Plasma Cell Disease Group, Hematology Oncology Committee of the China Anti-Cancer Association (CACA) have revised the 2019 consensus based on the latest evidence. This updated consensus focuses on refining the testing workflows, harmonizing the interpretation and reporting of high-risk genetic abnormalities, and discussing the incorporation of emerging molecular markers into risk stratification. This new consensus aims to promote standardized and precision-based MM care in China and improve the identification and management of high-risk patients.","54":"This review summarizes how advances in bioinformatics are transforming pharmacogenomics by enabling prediction of individual drug responses and integration of pharmacogenomic data into clinical practice across multiple therapeutic areas. It aims to highlight key databases, computational tools, and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that support personalized medicine. Evidence from pharmacogenomic studies, centralized resources (for example, PharmGKB), and in silico prediction tools (such as PolyPhen and SIFT) is synthesized to illustrate how genetic variants affecting drug metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity are systematically analysed and translated into clinical applications. Pharmacogenomic applications in psychiatry, cardiology, oncology, and autoimmune disorders show that genetically guided therapies can enhance efficacy and reduce adverse effects. AI and machine learning improve interpretation of high-dimensional pharmacogenomic data, accelerating progress in precision medicine and drug discovery, although challenges such as computational complexity, data privacy, and underrepresentation of diverse populations persist. Bioinformatics technologies are central to operationalizing pharmacogenomics by enabling robust variant interpretation and data integration for individualized therapy. Addressing technical, ethical, and equity-related challenges will be critical to fully realizing the potential of pharmacogenomics and advancing precision health care.","55":"Drug resistance remains a significant obstacle in cancer therapy, severely compromising therapeutic efficacy and patient survival outcomes. Targeted therapy is now a central strategy for cancers with defined molecular abnormalities, employing agents that interact with specific genetic or molecular targets. Immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach in oncology by enhancing the immune system's ability to identify and eradicate cancer cells. Although microbial communities are increasingly acknowledged for their involvement in tumorigenesis and metastasis, their impact on drug resistance, including resistance to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, remains insufficiently investigated. Clinical evidence further reveals significant correlations between microbiota composition and survival outcomes, such as progression-free survival and recurrence rates. Microbiota contribute to resistance through complex mechanisms. Pathogenic bacteria can impair chemotherapy by degrading drugs and suppressing immune responses, whereas certain beneficial bacteria may enhance immunity and modulate metabolism. Notably, intratumoral microbiota directly modulate chemoresistance development through localized actions within the tumor microenvironment. This review synthesizes clinical data and mechanistic studies to delineate microbial-drug interactions, emphasizing how pathogens drive resistance through multifactorial pathways while probiotics mitigate treatment toxicity and restore drug sensitivity. We further propose novel therapeutic strategies leveraging microbe-drug interplay to overcome resistance and alleviate chemotherapy side effects, offering new approaches to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and targeted therapy. These findings advance the understanding of microbial contributions to drug resistance and provide new directions for clinical application in precision cancer therapy.","56":"Infection significantly increases morbidity and mortality in hematologic malignancies due to immunosuppression, multiple risk factors, and greater susceptibility to healthcare-associated infections. We conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis of ESBL and carbapenemase co-producing K. pneumoniae (KP-JZ177) isolate recovered from a vulnerable patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) in Jazan region, Saudi Arabia. A clinical K. pneumoniae (KP-JZ177) isolate was obtained from a wound swab of a female patient with AML in the Hematology-Oncology unit of a tertiary hospital in Jazan region. Identification and AST were performed using the MicroScan WalkAway system. Whole-genome sequencing enabled comprehensive characterization of the strain's genetic profile, resistance determinants, virulence factors, and plasmid replicons. KP-JZ177 isolate displayed resistance to all tested antimicrobials except amikacin, gentamicin, tigecycline, and colistin. The genomic features of KP-JZ177 indicate substantial adaptability and pathogenic potential. KP-JZ177 belongs to sequence type ST147, a globally recognized high-risk clone associated with carbapenem resistance and recurrent hospital outbreaks. Its extensive drug-resistant (XDR) profile is driven by the co-occurrence of carbapenemase genes bla<sub>OXA-48<\/sub> and bla<sub>NDM-1<\/sub>, which together confer high-level \u03b2-lactam resistance. Serotyping classified the isolate as KL64 with an O1\/O2v1 O-antigen. Genomic analysis also revealed eight plasmids, many carried \u03b2-lactamase determinants and several mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Genomic profiling of KP-JZ177 reveals high-risk K. pneumoniae clone carrying extensive resistance and virulence determinants on multiple plasmids, including bla<sub>OXA-48<\/sub> and bla<sub>NDM-1<\/sub>. Its plasmids similarity to geographically distant strains underscore global AMR circulation, emphasizing the need for enhanced surveillance of ST147 CRKP isolates in high-risk populations.","57":"Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) have become an integral part of standard care for rectal cancer, but evidence-based detailed guidance is lacking to support its clinical implementation and use. This European SocieTy for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) technical guideline aimed to assess the available evidence and provide recommendations for their use in rectal cancer treatment. The ESTRO Lower Gastrointestinal (GI) Cancer guidelines subcommittee formed a writing panel to address key questions (KQs) on the application of IMRT and IGRT in rectal cancer management. The panel conducted a literature review and where evidence was insufficient, expert consensus was used. The writing panel (2 RTTs, 2 medical physics experts, 3 radiation oncologists) identified 14 KQs. Recommendations were based on low to moderate evidence and\/or expert consensus. Supine positioning is preferred for patient comfort and stability. Comfortable full bladder should be used. For OAR delineation and dose optimization, mandatory (Bladder, Bowel Cavity, Femoral Heads) and optional OAR were defined. Auto-delineation is supported for OAR and can be considered for target volumes. Dose metrics for minimizing gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity were identified. Auto-planning tools and MR-only workflows are feasible, both require proper QA. Uncertainties from setup and target volume shape variations must be accounted for with appropriately defined margins. Daily volumetric image guidance is recommended for treatment verification. This ESTRO technical guideline for the use of IMRT and IGRT for rectal cancer was developed to support development and implementation into clinics.","58":"No abstract available","59":"Children with cancer frequently experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as mucositis, nausea, vomiting, and feed intolerance, impairing nutritional intake and often necessitating parenteral nutrition (PN). However, standardized criteria guiding PN initiation in pediatric oncology remain poorly defined. This study examined PN use in pediatric oncology patients, identifying key indications, patterns, and clinical considerations. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on pediatric oncology patients who received PN at a tertiary cancer center in New Zealand between June 2018 and December 2021. Data on demographics, diagnosis, nutritional status, PN indications, duration, concurrent enteral nutrition (EN), and clinical outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics. PN was prescribed in 108 episodes for 62 children (mean age: 7.3\u00a0y). The primary indication was mucositis (59%), followed by neutropenic enteritis (19%). PN duration was longer in hematologic malignancies than in solid tumors (P=0.014). Malnutrition was present in 44% of patients at PN initiation. Using hospital guidelines, 77% trialed EN before PN, and EN duration before PN was deemed adequate in 62%. Concurrent EN was more common in nonhematologic (98%) than hematologic diagnoses (93%; P=0.003). PN remains essential in pediatric oncology, particularly for patients with severe mucositis. Clearer PN initiation criteria are needed to minimize overuse and associated risks.","60":"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a significant global health challenge. In Morocco, while the prevalence of HAIs has been studied in university hospitals, limited research has focused on the effectiveness of infection prevention and control (IPC) programs. This study evaluates the adherence of 8 Moroccan hospitals to IPC standards using the Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Framework (IPCAF). Eight Moroccan hospitals participated in this study. The IPC compliance of each hospital was assessed using the IPCAF tool, which evaluates IPC committees, staff training, infrastructure, and surveillance systems. The study showed significant variation in IPCAF scores. Hospitals such as Maternity and Reproductive Health Hospital - Orangers, Ibn Sina Hospital, and National Institute of Oncology achieved high compliance, with scores of 657.5 and 652.5, reflecting 82.19% and 81.56% compliance. These hospitals demonstrated strong IPC committees, effective training, and consistent surveillance. In contrast, Arrazi Hospital and Souissi Maternity had lower scores, with HAI scoring 352.5, indicating gaps in IPC practices. The lower-scoring hospitals struggled with infrastructure, staff involvement, and adherence to IPC guidelines. The study highlights the importance of leadership commitment, regular training, and surveillance to improve IPC outcomes. It emphasizes the need for targeted interventions in underperforming hospitals to address gaps in infrastructure and staff involvement, thereby enhancing patient safety and infection control standards in Morocco.","61":"No abstract available","62":"Spatial transcriptomics maps whole-transcriptome profiles directly onto tissue sections, correlating between cellular neighborhoods and gene expression and how these activities drive health and disease. Although the approach has transformed oncology, neuroscience, immunology, developmental sciences, and many fields, it has been less widely used in vascular biology, even though vascular disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Two obstacles stand out: arteries and veins offer little flat surface for sectioning, and diseased specimens, often atherosclerotic, thrombosed, plaque-laden, or calcified, require harsh treatments such as decalcification that jeopardize morphology and RNA integrity. Yet these same vessels, with their concentric intima, media, and adventitia layered structures, are ideal for spatial analysis because each layer hosts distinct cell types and gene programs that interact across the wall. Few detailed protocols address how to prepare vascular tissues for spatial transcriptomics. This shortage limits researchers' ability to exploit the technique's full potential. To bridge the gap, we present a step-by-step workflow optimized for human tibial arteries with advanced lesions. The protocol covers tissue handling, fixation, and proper decalcification that preserve structure and RNA quality, followed by histological staining to grade calcification severity. We also describe the construction of tissue microarray (TMA) to curb batch effects and region of interest (ROI) selection strategies on the NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP). By lowering technical barriers, this protocol enables vascular researchers to generate reliable spatial transcriptomic data and study layer-specific transcriptional activities in healthy and diseased vessels. We anticipate that it will accelerate the discovery of mechanisms underlying calcification, inflammation, intimal atherosclerosis, and other vascular pathologies and foster broader adoption of spatial transcriptomics in vascular biology.","63":"Malignancy-associated hypercalcemia (MAH) is one of the most frequent and life-threatening metabolic emergencies in oncology; however, it is rarely observed in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). We report the perioperative management of a 48-year-old man with a left long-standing anterior knee scar complicated by recurrent ulceration. In August 2024, pathology confirmed well-differentiated cSCC; however, the patient was lost to follow-up. One year later, he presented with a progressive ulcer, fatigue, severe hypercalcemia, and renal impairment. Laboratory evaluation revealed suppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels consistent with MAH. Computed tomography angiography showed extensive ulceration with bone destruction and vascular involvement, and FAPI-PET\/CT confirmed local recurrence and skeletal metastases in the contralateral tibia. Preoperative optimization consisted of isotonic crystalloid resuscitation, calcitonin, antiresorptive therapy with intravenous bisphosphonates or denosumab, and short-course continuous renal replacement therapy as indicated, allowing the patient to meet the physiologic criteria required for anesthesia induction. An above-knee amputation was performed using staged vascular control with continuous hemodynamic monitoring, followed by intensive care unit admission for targeted calcium-lowering therapy and organ support. The postoperative course was notable for the absence of fatal arrhythmias or deep surgical infection. This case highlights that, in cSCC complicated by MAH, skeletal metastases, and chronic infection, adherence to explicit physiologic thresholds for anesthesia induction within a standardized perioperative pathway -- combined with advanced imaging for metabolic and anatomic stratification -- can create a safe operative window of time, mitigate acute risks, and improve the feasibility and safety of definitive oncologic surgery in a high-risk setting.","64":"The expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a critical biomarker for guiding precision therapy in HER2-positive cancers. However, conventional diagnostic approaches are invasive and fail to resolve the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of HER2 expression. Molecular imaging using HER2-targeted probes provides a noninvasive alternative, enabling quantitative assessment of HER2 status at the whole-body level. This capability supports critical clinical needs including early molecular subtyping, sensitive detection of metastases, and dynamic monitoring of treatment response. This review focuses on the rational design and engineering strategies of emerging HER2-targeted probes, highlighting key advances in probe architecture and functional optimization. We systematically evaluate how optimization strategies improve imaging contrast, metabolic stability, and targeting specificity. Despite considerable preclinical progress, the widespread clinical translation of these probes remains challenged by issues in scalable manufacturing, reproducible quality control, and regulatory validation. Addressing these application barriers represents a critical objective for future research to fully realize the potential of HER2-targeted molecular imaging in precision oncology.","65":"Considering the stress of parenting a child through cancer and given prior findings that parental stress can affect children's neuropsychological functioning, the present study examined the relative effects of treatment and family environment on attentional functioning in pediatric cancer survivors. Our sample of survivors (<i>N<\/i>\u2009=\u2009122; 40.9% female; 51.8% non-Hispanic White) was 3.77\u2009\u00b1\u20093.58\u2009years post-treatment. Multiple linear regression analyses examined demographic, treatment, and family environment factors with respect to parent-reported, self-reported, and performance-based attention. Treatment factors did not significantly predict any form of attentional functioning. Lower socioeconomic status and less social support significantly predicted greater parent-reported hyperactivity and attention problems. Greater parental stress significantly predicted greater parent-reported attention problems, but not parent-reported hyperactivity. Family environment factors uniquely accounted for the most variance in predicted parent-report hyperactivity (total <i>r<\/i><sub>s<\/sub><sup>2<\/sup>\u2009=\u2009.489) and attention problems (total <i>r<\/i><sub>s<\/sub><sup>2<\/sup>\u2009=\u2009.686). Although non-significant, worse parental anxiety and depression also were associated with greater parent-reported hyperactivity and attention problems. Results suggest that family environment factors can strongly predict parent-reported hyperactivity and attention problems in pediatric cancer survivors. These findings highlight the importance of assessing parental stress and emotional functioning in future research on neuropsychological outcomes for pediatric cancer survivors, with potential implications for clinical interventions.","66":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is notable for its marked molecular heterogeneity and poor response to systemic therapy. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) has facilitated the profiling of somatic alterations in HCC. However, the interpretation of panel-based genomic features such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), copy number alterations, and candidate gene fusions remains challenging, particularly in HBV-endemic Asian populations. To explore the somatic mutation landscape of HCC using a targeted sequencing panel in a regional cohort and to descriptively assess its associations with clinicopathological characteristics. We conducted a 671-gene targeted NGS panel covering approximately 2.5\u00a0Mb of coding regions on tumor-normal paired samples from 40 patients with HCC and integrated the mutational profiles with clinicopathological data. We analyzed somatic mutations, copy number variation signals, and candidate fusion events. We performed functional enrichment analyses and comparative analyses with the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. Survival analyses were conducted in an exploratory manner. TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene (55%) and its mutation status was associated with hepatitis B virus infection, higher Edmondson-Steiner grade, and microvascular invasion. Panel-derived TMB values were evaluated descriptively, and exploratory survival analyses suggested potential differences between patient subgroups. Two candidate in-frame fusion signals, KIT-PDGFRA and ROS1-FBXL17, were detected in individual samples based on targeted DNA sequencing. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that mutated genes were mainly associated with cancer-related biological processes. This study provides an exploratory overview of somatic alterations detected by a targeted sequencing panel in a regional HCC cohort. Given the limitations inherent to panel-based analyses and the lack of independent validation, these findings should be interpreted cautiously and primarily serve as a reference for future large-scale and experimentally validated studies aimed at refining precision oncology strategies in HCC.","67":"Toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, affects a significant proportion of the global population. While typically asymptomatic in healthy individuals due to effective immune responses, immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, are at risk of developing acute toxoplasmosis due to the reactivation of latent infection. This study aims to investigate the seroprevalence of latent T. gondii infection among cancer patients who were registered with the Iranian National Registry Center for Toxoplasmosis (INRCT), before and after chemotherapy, and to determine the relationship between chemotherapy and IgG antibody responses. This cross-sectional study investigated the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection and its relationship with chemotherapy in 107 cancer patients with solid organ tumors. Participants were recruited from oncology centers in Sari, northern Iran, between 2023 and 2024 and were assessed for anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM antibodies using ELISA before and three weeks after chemotherapy initiation. At baseline, 80.4% of patients were IgG positive, indicating prior T. gondii exposure. Three weeks post-chemotherapy, 28.92% showed a significant increase in IgG titers. While age was significantly associated with Toxoplasma infection at baseline (P\u2009<\u20090.05), no significant associations were found between demographic or clinical characteristics and IgG seropositivity or titer changes post-chemotherapy. Breast cancer patients exhibited the highest prevalence of Toxoplasma IgG. These findings suggest a high prevalence of latent toxoplasmosis in cancer patients, with chemotherapy potentially influencing IgG titers in a subset of individuals, independent of other factors examined. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of these observations.","68":"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors originating from neural crest-derived chromaffin tissue, marked by clinical heterogeneity and substantial genetic underpinnings. With up to 70% of cases linked to germline or somatic mutations, including Succinate DeHydrogenase genetic alterations (SDHx), and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), genetic profiling is central to diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapeutic planning. Clinical presentation varies by tumor location and secretory status-from catecholamine-driven crises to mass effect in head and neck paragangliomas (H&N PGLs). The diagnostic workflow begins with biochemical testing, followed by high-resolution anatomical and functional imaging. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remain essential for localization and staging, while radiopharmaceuticals such as \u2076\u2078Ga-DOTA\u2070-Tyr\u00b3-octreotate (\u2076\u2078Ga-DOTATATE), \u00b9\u2078F-fluoro-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (\u00b9\u2078F-FDOPA), and \u00b9\u00b3\u00b9I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (\u00b9\u00b3\u00b9I-MIBG) refine tumor characterization and guide peptide receptor radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) with radiolabeled octreotide derivatives or therapeutic MIBG Imaging features such as size, necrosis, and diffusion restriction correlate with malignancy risk, but novel molecular imaging offer promise for more precise prognostication. Therapeutic options span from curative surgery to systemic therapies, including temozolomide, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and nuclide therapy. Minimally invasive, image-guided interventions provide palliation for metastatic or inoperable disease. Importantly, artificial intelligence and molecular assays such as the NETest and \u00b9H-MRS are emerging as pivotal tools in real-time tumor monitoring, early relapse detection, and biomarker discovery. This review underscores the necessity of a multidisciplinary, genomics-informed, and imaging-guided approach to PPGL management. With the integration of advanced imaging and AI-driven analytics, precision oncology for PPGLs is transitioning from potential to practice. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This article offers an overview of the diverse manifestations of paragangliomas, illustrated with examples from various anatomical locations. It also highlights different patterns of tumor evolution and provides an up-to-date review of current management and therapeutic strategies, with a special focus on emerging AI-guided approaches. KEY POINTS: Review the genetic associations, including Von Hippel-Lindau, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, Neurofibromatosis, and Carney Triad. Overview of anatomical imaging features (CT and MRI) of paragangliomas. Improve knowledge about the different Nuclear Medicine and functional imaging techniques in detecting lesions, depending on their location, secretory function and underlying genetic mutation. Discuss the multiple radiopharmaceuticals available for Scintigraphy and PET-CT, according to the paraganglioma site and mutational pattern.","69":"No abstract available","70":"To identify clinical and laboratory risk factors for invasive infection in febrile oncology patients seen in the Pediatric Emergency Department, depending on the type of cancer. We conducted a prospective observational study of febrile oncology patients seen between 2016 and 2023 at the Pediatric Emergency Department of a tertiary teaching hospital. Invasive infection was defined microbiologically (isolation of a bacterial pathogen in sterile fluid or a commensal bacterial species in 2 different blood cultures) or clinically (death, meeting Phoenix criteria for sepsis, receiving inotropic support, or developing acute complications or sequelae). We performed separate multivariate analyses for hematologic cancers and solid tumors. Hematologic cancers were further classified considering the myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy received. We classified the following as high-risk hematologic cancers: acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the induction, reinduction, or consolidation phase or relapse, and acute myeloid leukemia in any phase. We included 471 episodes: 306 hematologic cancers and 165 solid tumors. The median age was 4 years (interquartile range: 2 to 10) and the median duration of fever was 2 hours (interquartile range: 1 to 3). Invasive infections were diagnosed in 69 cases (14.6%). The rate was higher among patients with high-risk hematologic cancers (n=45, 23.2%), than among those with solid tumors (n=18, 10.9%; P=0.002) or with low-risk hematologic cancers (n=6, 5.4%; P<0.001). Among patients with hematological cancers, presenting a high-risk cancer (OR: 6.006; 95% CI: 2.459-18.200) and elevated procalcitonin levels (OR: 1.668; 95% CI: 1.205-2.571) were predictors of invasive infection [AUC for the model: 0.718 (95% CI: 0.640-0.795)]. Only age (OR: 1.145; 95% CI: 1.036-1.267) was found to be an independent risk factor in patients with solid tumors. In patients with hematologic cancers and very recent onset fever, the type of cancer and procalcitonin level are useful for predicting the risk of invasive infection.","71":"The tumor microenvironment in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) is a complex network of malignant-host cell interactions, yet its orchestration remains poorly understood. We present a single-cell spatial atlas of metastatic HGSC from 280 patients, integrating high-dimensional imaging and molecular profiling. Analyzing 929 single-cell maps, we identify spatial domains with diverse cell compositions and show that immune cell co-infiltration at the tumor-stroma interface impacts clinical outcomes. Using CEFIIRA, we find that tumor cell MHCII expression is a key predictor of prolonged survival. Validation with deconvoluted, single-cell, and two distinct spatial transcriptomic datasets, along with immunopeptidomic analysis, confirms that MHCII expression correlates with immune activation, antigen presentation, and TCR clonality. Using a patient-derived immuno-oncology platform, we demonstrate that tumor MHCII expression associates with increased CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity after PD-1 blockade, while blocking MHCII inhibits this activation. Our atlas offers new insights into immune activation, potentially improving patient stratification in HGSC.","72":"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4\/6) inhibitors play an important role in the management of metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. They act by inhibiting the proteins CDK4 and CDK6, which are implicated in the advancement of the cell cycle and unchecked cell proliferation- the primary causes of the development of cancer. The blocking of these proteins can slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. Palbociclib is a highly active substance in the management of hormone positive, her2neu negative metastatic breast cancer [1]. A retrospective study was conducted at King Fahad Hospital (Al Jaber Oncology Centre). Sixty-four metastatic, hormone-positive, HER2neu-negative breast cancer cases who received. Palbociclib were included in the study and followed up for a median time of 30 months. Our study indicated that 58 patients were treated with Palbociclib combined with \u00a0letrozole (90.6%), whereas 6 patients (9.4%) were treated with Palbociclib along with \u00a0fulvestrant. Neutropenia induced by Palbociclib occurred in 87.5% of cases, whereas \u00a012.5% of cases did not experience neutropenia (8 cases). Regarding neutropenia, our \u00a0study showed that 32.1% of the participants experienced grade I neutropenia, while \u00a058.9% had grades II, and 8.9% had grade III neutropenia. A dose reduction of \u00a0Palbociclib was implemented in 19 cases (29.7%) throughout the entire treatment \u00a0duration. \u00a0With the adjustment of the dose of Palbociclib, there was no statistically significant difference between the different doses. The 30-month PFS rate was 75% with the dose of 100 mg, 90.9% with 75 mg, and 97.2% with the dose of 125 mg. Median PFS was not reached. A total of 5 deaths were noted in the entire study group. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival based on neutropenia grades. Neutropenia induced by palbociclib and subsequent dose reduction did not impact the disease outcome.","73":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. Variability in patient response to fluoropyrimidine-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains a critical challenge. We aimed to develop a nomogram that integrated dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) expression to predict CapeOX (Capecitabine-Oxaliplatin) neoadjuvant chemotherapy outcomes in colorectal cancer. A prospective cohort of 36 advanced-stage CRC patients who received CapeOX neoadjuvant chemotherapy at Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital from 2024 to 2025 was analyzed. mRNA expression levels of TS, DPD, and MTHFR were measured in tissue and blood using quantitative RT-PCR. The chemotherapy response was evaluated by RECIST 1.1. Statistical analysis was performed to identify predictors of response, which were incorporated into a nomogram with bootstrap validation. Among the 36 patients with advanced colorectal cancer, response to CapeOX chemotherapy was observed in 50%. Blood-based gene profiling revealed that responders had significantly lower DPD and MTHFR expression compared with non-responders (both p<0.001), while TS showed no predictive relevance. A nomogram that integrated only blood DPD and MTHFR achieved outstanding discrimination (AUC 0.932, C-index 0.78) and demonstrated strong calibration, accurately predicting treatment response across probability ranges. These results established circulating DPD and MTHFR as powerful non-invasive biomarkers and validated the nomogram as a robust tool for individualized response prediction. A predictive nomogram that incorporated DPD and MTHFR has improved individualized estimation of CapeOX neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in CRC, supporting precision oncology strategies.<br \/>.","74":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have markedly improved CML outcomes. Yet, resistance may develop due to mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain, particularly in the ATP-binding loop (P-loop), activation loop (A-loop), catalytic domain, and direct binding site. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, hematological response, and overall survival among CML patients receiving TKI therapy at Wahidin Sudirohusodo General Hospital, Makassar. A prospective cohort study was conducted from March 2022 to July 2023 at the Hematology-Oncology outpatient clinic. Among 312 patients, 22 were classified as non-responders (no hematological response within three months) and 290 as responders. Forty-four patients (22 responders and 22 non-responders) underwent mutation analysis, and survival outcomes were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Of the 44 patients, 11 harbored BCR-ABL mutations: S348L (n=6), T315I (n=4), and Y253F (n=1). All mutations were identified exclusively in the non-responder group. Mortality was significantly higher in non-responders than responders (p<0.05), and among non-responders with mutations compared to those without (p<0.01). Six-month survival rates were 65% for S348L, 50% for T315I, and 0% for Y253F, though survival differences between mutation types were not statistically significant (p=0,641). CML patients achieving early hematological response to TKI therapy had significantly better survival outcomes. In contrast, non-responders, particularly those harboring BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, demonstrated poorer survival. The S348L mutation was the most common variant in this cohort. Early mutation detection may help guide therapeutic adjustments and improve outcomes in TKI-resistant CML.","75":"The work environment of oncology nurses exposes them to patient suffering, making them vulnerable to developing Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS). Most research on STS has been conducted in high-income countries with stable healthcare systems, whereas little is known about its occurrence or risk factors in conflict-affected regions. This study aims to determine the prevalence of STS and identify its predictors among Palestinian oncology nurses who face unstable political conditions, insufficient resources, and limited mental health services. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in ten oncology departments across hospitals in the West Bank and East Jerusalem between August and October 2024. A total of 293 participants completed a questionnaire assessing sociodemographic characteristics, STS, burnout, social and organizational support, and coping strategies. Data were analyzed using SPSS 27 with descriptive and inferential statistics, including regression analyses to identify significant predictors. The mean STS score was 3.13 \u00b1 0.73, with the intrusion-related symptoms being most prominent (3.18 \u00b1 0.94). STS levels varied significantly with age, working hours, and parental status. Regression analysis identified the number of children as a negative predictor of STS (B = -0.081, p = 0.004), while education level (B = 0.096, p = 0.034) and Personal Accomplishment (B = 0.015, p < 0.001) were positive predictors. Perceived Organizational Support remained a strong negative predictor (B = -0.109, p < 0.001). This study provides the first evidence of STS among oncology nurses in a conflict-affected work environment. Strengthening organizational support and tailoring coping strategies to the local context may help reduce STS while promoting nurse well-being. These findings underscore the global relevance of integrating stress management programs into oncology education and workplace policies.","76":"The aim of this study was to examine melatonin as a potential adjunct therapy for managing treatment-related symptoms in prostate cancer patients, particularly those undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In light of the increasing incidence of prostate cancer among younger males, this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Hematology-Oncology Center of Omid Hospital in Isfahan, Iran, between October 2019 and October 2020. Forty-one prostate cancer patients experiencing hot flashes or sexual dysfunction due to ADT were randomly assigned to receive either melatonin (3 mg twice daily) or a placebo for four weeks. Symptom assessment was performed using the Hot Flash Diary, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire. The results showed a statistically significant improvement in FACT-P scores within the melatonin group (P < 0.05), while erectile function scores increased modestly in both groups without reaching statistical significance (P > 0.05). The most pronounced effect was observed in the reduction of the frequency of mild hot flashes in the melatonin group, with significant improvements noted by week four (P < 0.05). Melatonin was well tolerated, with no clinically significant adverse events reported. These findings suggest that melatonin may effectively alleviate vasomotor symptoms and enhance the quality of life in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT. However, its impact on sexual function remains inconclusive. Further large-scale, long-term studies incorporating mechanistic endpoints are needed to validate these findings and inform clinical guidelines for melatonin use in supportive prostate cancer care.","77":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been widely implemented in current oncology practice. However, there is limited data regarding ICI administration in pregnancy. This systematic review aims to evaluate the risk-benefit of ICI exposure in pregnant women. We conducted searches in databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase from January 1, 2011 through April 30, 2025. Included studies were those that involved women with a cancer diagnosis who received ICI treatment while pregnant and had clinical findings of the fetus post-ICI treatment. Methodological quality and potential sources of bias were assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. The search generated 2539 citations. After removal of 696 duplicates, a total of 1843 citations were screened. Twenty case reports and three retrospective studies were included in the systematic review. Fetal complications and fetal immune-related adverse events among the case reports were at 23% and 11.5%, respectively. Preterm delivery occurred in 54% of case reports, and no fetal mortalities were reported. Regarding the observational studies, preterm delivery occurred in 20.9%-25.5% of cases, fetal mortality occurred in 2.2%-15.3% of cases, intrauterine growth restriction occurred in 6.5%-7.1% of cases, and complications attributable to prematurity were reported in 2.6%-5.5% of cases. The data from this systematic review suggests that the risk for fetal complications may be lower than previously reported. As ICIs continue to expand their role in the treatment of malignancy, their use in pregnancy is more likely to come into clinical question. Clinicians should approach ICI use in pregnancy with individualized, multi-disciplinary risk-benefit discussions.","78":"Antiviral therapies for hepatitis B or C virus may be associated with reduced risk of tumor recurrence and mortality of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing curative treatments, compared to untreated patients. Previous studies comparing survival outcomes between percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and liver resection (LR) for treating patients with very early-stage HCC did not evaluate the effects of antiviral treatments on survival outcome. Our study aimed to clarify this issue. From 2011 to 2021, 265 patients undergoing LR and 269 patients undergoing RFA for very early-stage HCC (i.e., a single tumor \u22642\u2009cm without macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status = 0 and Child-Pugh class A liver disease) were included in this retrospective study. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan\u2009-\u2009Meier method after propensity score matching (PSM). After 1:1 PSM (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u2009205 in both groups), the survival benefit of LR was significantly higher than that of RFA (five-year OS: 85% vs. 73%; <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.004; five-year RFS: 64% vs. 45%; <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001). For patients with very early-stage HCC, LR was associated with superior OS and RFS compared to RFA.","79":"Thymectomy is a cornerstone in the management of thymic epithelial tumors and myasthenia gravis (MG). While minimally invasive techniques like video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) have gained prominence, robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) has emerged as a technically advanced alternative. However, comparative long-term oncological outcomes between RATS and VATS remain underexplored. This review aims to compare RATS and VATS thymectomy regarding long-term outcomes, perioperative results, and cost. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, with a protocol registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251126351). PubMed\/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched for comparative studies reporting long-term outcomes (\u226512 months follow-up) of RATS versus VATS thymectomy. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Three retrospective cohort studies (430 patients: 181 RATS, 249 VATS) were included. No significant differences were found in long-term oncological outcomes: 5-year progression-free survival (RATS 87.7% <i>vs.<\/i> VATS 90.6%, P=0.504) and overall survival (87.7% <i>vs.<\/i> 92.2%) were comparable. Recurrence and reoperation rates were low and similar between groups. In MG patients, RATS was associated with a higher rate of complete stable remission (26% <i>vs.<\/i> 18%, P=0.06) and was an independent predictor of remission (hazard ratio: 0.472, P=0.049). Perioperatively, RATS demonstrated advantages including lower conversion rates (3% <i>vs.<\/i> 15%, P=0.03), shorter operative time (median 100 <i>vs.<\/i> 120 min, P=0.039), and reduced hospital stay (mean 1.3 <i>vs.<\/i> 2.4 days, P=0.01). Complication rates were similarly low. However, RATS was significantly more costly (\u00a568,122 <i>vs.<\/i> \u00a537,886, P<0.001). RATS and VATS thymectomy yield equivalent long-term oncological outcomes. RATS offers superior perioperative recovery and may enhance neurological remission in MG patients, but at a significantly higher cost. The choice of technique should consider clinical context, surgeon expertise, and economic factors.","80":"Gastric cancer (GC) with peritoneal dissemination remains a challenge with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. We aimed to compare solvent-based paclitaxel (sb-PTX) + ramucirumab (RAM) vs. nanoparticle-albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX) + RAM as second-line therapy for unresectable or recurrent GC with peritoneal dissemination. This prospective, randomised, open-label, multicentre phase 2 trial was conducted at 58 centres within the West Japan Oncology Group (WJOG) in Japan. Eligible participants were patients with histologically-confirmed GC with peritoneal dissemination refractory or intolerant to first-line therapy. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive sb-PTX + RAM or nab-PTX + RAM. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), safety, and protocol-specified biomarker analyses including the assessment of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression by immunohistochemistry on archival tumour specimens. The data cutoff for the analysis presented herein was January 27, 2021. This trial was registered in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs031180022). Between Oct 1, 2018, and Jan 27, 2020, 105 patients were assigned to sb-PTX + RAM (n = 53) or nab-PTX + RAM (n = 52). Median follow-up was 18.1 months. Median OS was 8.1 months with sb-PTX + RAM and 7.2 months with nab-PTX + RAM (HR [nab-PTX + RAM vs. sb-PTX + RAM], 0.960; 95% CI, 0.621-1.484; P = 0.631). Median PFS was 5.1 vs. 3.9 months (HR [nab-PTX + RAM vs. sb-PTX + RAM], 0.965; 95% CI, 0.642-1.450; P = 0.893). ORR was 20.7% vs. 20.0% (P = 0.993), and DCR was 77.4% vs. 63.5% (P = 0.150), with sb-PTX + RAM and nab-PTX + RAM. Grade\u22653 neuropathy occurred in 7.5% with sb-PTX + RAM and 17.6% with nab-PTX + RAM, and febrile neutropenia in 11.3% vs. 5.9%. In biomarker analysis, OS and PFS improved stepwise with increasing Cav-1 expression in patients receiving nab-PTX + RAM (P = 0.007, P = 0.012); no such association was observed with sb-PTX + RAM. Among patients with high stromal Cav-1 expression (IHC score 3+), nab-PTX + RAM showed some evidence of improved OS compared with sb-PTX + RAM (HR [nab-PTX + RAM vs. sb-PTX + RAM], 0.371; 95% CI, 0.130-1.060; P = 0.055). The interaction between Cav-1 expression and treatment arm showed a non-significant trend (HR for interaction, 0.364; 95% CI, 0.115-1.152; P = 0.086), consistent with this finding. Treatment with nab-PTX + RAM did not meet the prespecified threshold (HR < 0.90) for promising efficacy in patients with GC and peritoneal dissemination. High stromal Cav-1 expression was associated with improved efficacy of nab-PTX + RAM. Future studies should prospectively validate the predictive value of stromal Cav-1 in patients receiving nab-PTX + RAM. Taiho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.","81":"Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is a rare trans-synaptic degeneration of the inferior olivary nucleus resulting from disruption of the dentato-rubro-olivary pathway, also known as the Guillain- Mollaret triangle. Unlike most degenerative processes, it produces olivary hypertrophy rather than atrophy. In oncology patients with prior posterior fossa or brainstem involvement, this condition can simulate tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis, leading to unnecessary interventions if unrecognized. A 38-year-old woman with a history of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and previously treated brainstem metastasis presented with progressive right facial paresthesias and gait instability. Neurological examination revealed dysmetria, impaired rapid alternating movements, and gait ataxia without motor or sensory deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a nodular enhancing pontine lesion due to the treated metastatic lesion and a new enlargement involving the rostral aspect of the left central tegmental tract with associated hypertrophic change of the inferior olivary nucleus, consistent with unilateral HOD. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and perfusion imaging excluded neoplastic recurrence. A multidisciplinary neuro-oncology board concluded that the findings were secondary to radiation-induced tract injury. The patient continued maintenance chemotherapy and received symptomatic management and rehabilitative therapy, with serial MRI showing stability. HOD should be considered in patients with prior brainstem surgery or radiotherapy who develop delayed cerebellar signs and characteristic MRI findings. Recognizing its benign and self-limited nature is crucial to prevent misdiagnosis as tumor recurrence and avoid unnecessary oncologic or surgical interventions. Integration of advanced MRI techniques and multidisciplinary evaluation allows precise diagnosis and tailored management, ensuring appropriate treatment and long-term follow-up.","82":"To optimize patient selection for first-line immune-checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy (ICI-Chemo) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we developed a 9-gene Immune-Chemotherapy Prediction Score (ICPscore) from the phase 3 ORIENT-11 trial. A high ICPscore identified patients with markedly superior progression-free and overall survival from ICI-Chemo versus chemotherapy alone, whereas low-scorers derived minimal benefit, outperforming existing biomarkers such as PD-L1. Its predictive value for immunotherapy efficacy was further validated in the OAK (NSCLC) and IMvigor210 (metastatic urothelial cancer) cohorts. Multi-cohort and single-cell analyses linked a high ICPscore to an immune-active tumor microenvironment characterized by myeloid cell activation, thus providing a biological rationale for its enhanced performance and positioning it as a robust tool for treatment personalization.","83":"High-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is treated with intravesical instillations of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), which trigger a local immune response. Improved patient outcomes have been linked to the recruitment of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T helper type 1 (Th1) cells to the bladder. However, specific antigens recognized by the bladder-infiltrating T cells remain largely unknown. In this study, we followed thirty-two patients with NMIBC undergoing BCG immunotherapy. Longitudinal blood and urine samples were collected to investigate the dynamics and characteristics of BCG-specific T cells. We detected pre-existing BCG-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in most BCG therapy-naive patients before treatment induction. BCG immunotherapy increased the frequency and memory differentiation of circulating BCG-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, which displayed a polyfunctional Th1 phenotype. Importantly, we provide evidence that BCG-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> Th1 cells can be detected in urine during therapy, suggesting their recruitment to the bladder. This study provides novel biological insights into the cellular mechanisms of BCG-induced immunity in bladder cancer.","84":"The effective treatment of bladder cancer depends on early evaluation through cystoscopy. Given the clinical importance of distinguishing the tumor grade, we report the application of the AI-assisted NBI Cystoscopy Diagnostic System (AINCDS). The AINCDS consists of (1) dual-channel feature extraction module, (2) lesion segmentation module based on feature pyramids, and (3) a multi-task classification module. AINCDS achieved an accuracy for identifying bladder cancer of 0.919 (95% CI = 0.896 to 0.938). For the prediction of tumor grade, the accuracy was 0.764 (95% CI = 0.714 to 0.810). The AINCDS demonstrates similar ability comparable to urologists with over 10 years' experience. With the assistance of AINCDS, the tumor grade prediction accuracy of urologists with 1-3 years' experience improved from 0.667 to 0.793. AINCDS can assist in the diagnosis of bladder cancer and prediction of tumor grade, offering the potential to improve the accuracy of lesion assessment and reduce the workload of urologists.","85":"No abstract available","86":"Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized modern oncology by mobilizing the body's immune system, yet its efficacy remains severely limited in immunologically \"cold\" tumors, which are defined by poor immune infiltration and low tumor immunogenicity. Here, we report a multi-functional nanoplatform that integrates a new second near-infrared (NIR-II) aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen), a mitochondria-targeted lonidamine prodrug, and cryo-shocked M1 macrophage membranes (CSMs) to achieve synergistic tumor microenvironment (TME) reprogramming and precision image-guided immunotherapy. The bright NIR-II AIEgen enables high-resolution fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging for real-time tumor visualization and photothermal therapy. The prodrug LND-1-PEG-24, cleavable by TME-overexpressed cathepsin B, preferentially accumulates in mitochondria to trigger caspase-3\/GSDME-mediated pyroptosis, leading to the release of danger-associated molecular patterns that markedly enhance tumor immunogenicity. Simultaneously, CSMs promote durable polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward the tumoricidal M1 phenotype via the TLR2\/MAPK pathway, thereby alleviating TME immunosuppression. In tumor-bearing mice, this nanoplatform synergistically enhances cytotoxic T cell infiltration, reverses immune suppression, and effectively inhibits both primary tumor growth and metastatic progression through the activation of systemic antitumor immunity. This work establishes a versatile strategy that unifies NIR-II phototheranostics, mitochondria-targeting pyroptosis, and TAM reprogramming, providing a robust and targeted approach for cancer immunotherapy.","87":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as versatile and biocompatible nanocarriers for drug delivery, offering significant advantages over synthetic nanoparticles, which often suffer from rapid clearance, immunogenicity, and limited clinical translation. In this study, we introduce nanoalgosomes, a new class of EVs derived from the marine microalga <i>Tetraselmis chuii<\/i>, as biogenic carriers for doxorubicin delivery in breast cancer models. Nanoalgosomes exhibit high stability, in vivo biocompatibility, and efficient cargo-loading capacity, making them ideal for therapeutic applications. We optimized doxorubicin-loading strategy, preserving the structural integrity of nanoalgosomes while achieving efficient drug incorporation. Compared to free drug treatments, doxorubicin-loaded nanoalgosomes significantly enhanced drug uptake and its therapeutic effects in breast cancer models. Notably, doxorubicin-loaded nanoalgosomes exhibited a markedly enhanced chemotherapeutic potency compared to free doxorubicin. In 2D tumor cell cultures, nanoalgosomes reduced the doxorubicin the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50<\/sub>) by approximately 8-fold. In 3D tumor spheroids, which more closely recapitulate tumor architecture and drug penetration, the IC<sub>50<\/sub> decreased from >2.5\u00a0\u03bcM for free doxorubicin to 0.7\u00a0\u03bcM for the doxorubicin-loaded nanoalgosomes, resulting in about 60\u00a0% spheroid volume reduction. The superior efficacy of doxorubicin-loaded nanoalgosomes was further validated in vivo in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans<\/i>, where the IC<sub>50<\/sub> decreased 3-fold for the doxorubicin-loaded nanoalgosomes. These results highlight nanoalgosomes as a sustainable and scalable next-generation drug delivery platform for precision oncology, offering a promising alternative to synthetic nanocarriers.","88":"Decellularized extracellular matrices (dECMs) are promising biomaterials for generating tissue-specific <i>in vitro<\/i> models due to their organotypic extracellular matrix (ECM) protein profiles compared to natural and synthetic alternatives. However, most dECM-based hydrogels rely on collagen fibrillogenesis, resulting in limited mechanical tuneability and cell instructivity. Here, we developed LungMA, a photocrosslinkable, methacrylated lung dECM hydrogel engineered for precise stiffness modulation and tissue-specific lung cancer modelling. The decellularization process removed >99\u202f% of native DNA, ensuring minimal cellular remnants while preserving key ECM components including laminin-332, collagen VI, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2). Methacrylation and photoinitiation enabled formation of stable LungMA hydrogels with tunable stiffnesses ranging from 1\u202fkPa (healthy lung) to 4\u202fkPa (fibrotic lung). Using A549 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, we demonstrated that matrix composition and stiffness influenced cell morphology, proliferation, and drug response. Soft LungMA (1\u202fkPa) promoted motile, sheet-like cellular organization, whereas stiff LungMA (>4\u202fkPa) induced compact spheroids associated with chemoresistance. Increasing matrix stiffness resulted in an increase in doxorubicin IC<sub>50<\/sub> from 0.40\u202f\u03bcM (soft LungMA) to 1.23\u202f\u03bcM (stiff LungMA), and cisplatin IC<sub>50<\/sub> from 0.03\u202f\u03bcM to 8.34\u202f\u03bcM, reflecting clinical observations where fibrosis correlates with poor prognosis. In contrast, gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and basement membrane extract (BME)-based hydrogels failed to induce these stiffness-dependent effects during cisplatin treatment underscoring the instructive role of lung-specific ECM components and matrix stiffness on chemotherapeutic outcomes. LungMA provides a physiologically relevant, mechanically tunable, lung-specific platform that replicates <i>in vivo<\/i>-like cancer phenotypes and drug responses. This work supports the application of LungMA for oncology research, disease modelling, and high-throughput drug screening as a clinically relevant, non-animal alternative for lung cancer studies.","89":"Multiple Myeloma (MM) in dogs is typically treated with a combination of alkylating agents and corticosteroids. However, treatment failure or intolerance, often due to cumulative toxicities, can limit the long-term efficacy of these protocols. Thalidomide, an immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic drug widely used in human MM, remains largely unexplored in veterinary oncology. This study retrospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of thalidomide as a rescue therapy in dogs with MM that were refractory to or intolerant of standard treatments. Medical records from three referral centers were reviewed, identifying dogs that met the inclusion criteria. All seven selected dogs received melphalan, and four were also treated with cyclophosphamide prior to thalidomide. Thalidomide was administered once daily in all dogs, with one case requiring dose escalation. The median duration of thalidomide administration was 440 days (range: 146-580 days). A complete response was achieved or maintained in five dogs (71%). Adverse events (AEs) were limited to grade II lethargy in two cases, with no hematologic, gastrointestinal, or urinary AEs reported. The median PFS during thalidomide treatment was 490 days (95% CI: 408.7-571.4), while it was 180 days (95% CI: 54.8-305.2) during melphalan therapy. Median overall survival (OS), calculated from diagnosis to last follow-up, was 680 days (95% CI: 542.8-817.2). These findings suggest that thalidomide is a well-tolerated and potentially effective rescue therapy for canine MM, particularly in patients unresponsive to or unable to tolerate conventional chemotherapy. Further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate its efficacy as part of first-line or combined protocols.","90":"A decade ago, we characterized big data in healthcare as a nascent field anchored in distributed computing paradigms. The intervening years have witnessed a transformation so profound that revisiting our original framework is essential. This paper critically examines the evolution of big data in healthcare and medicine, assessing the shift from Hadoop-centric architectures to cloud computing platforms and GPU-accelerated artificial intelligence, including large language models and the emerging paradigm of agentic AI. The landscape has been reshaped by landmark biobank initiatives, breakthrough applications such as AlphaFold's Nobel Prize-winning solution to protein structure prediction, and the rapid growth of FDA-cleared AI medical devices from fewer than ten in 2015 to over 1200 by mid-2025. AI has enabled advances across precision oncology, drug discovery, and public health surveillance. Yet new challenges have emerged: algorithmic bias perpetuating health disparities, opacity undermining clinical trust, environmental sustainability concerns, and unresolved questions of privacy, security, data ownership, and interoperability. We propose extending the original \"4Vs\" framework to accommodate veracity through explainability, validity through fairness, and viability through sustainability. The paper concludes with prescriptive implications for healthcare organizations, technology developers, policymakers, and researchers.","91":"Alterations involving the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway are central drivers of pediatric and adult low-grade gliomas (LGGs), with BRAF fusions representing a dominant oncogenic mechanism in pilocytic astrocytoma. While KIAA1549::BRAF remains the most prevalent fusion, an expanding repertoire of alternative fusion partners continues to refine the molecular landscape of MAPK-driven gliomas and has important therapeutic implications. Here, we report a previously unrecognized ASAP1::BRAF fusion identified in a young adult with a World Health Organization grade 1 temporal lobe pilocytic astrocytoma, highlighting both its biological plausibility and potential relevance for targeted therapy. A 31-year-old female presented with new-onset seizures and underwent gross total resection of a well-circumscribed, partially cystic left temporal lobe tumor. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with pilocytic astrocytoma, demonstrating low proliferative activity and absence of high-grade features. Comprehensive molecular profiling using RNA-based next-generation sequencing revealed an in-frame ASAP1 exon 29::BRAF exon 9 fusion, preserving the intact C-terminal BRAF kinase domain while eliminating N-terminal regulatory regions. No additional pathogenic variants were detected. To substantiate the structural authenticity of the fusion, deep learning-based breakpoint validation using FusionAI was performed, yielding a high fusion probability score and supporting a bona fide genomic rearrangement rather than an RNA-sequencing artifact. Genomic feature annotation demonstrated enrichment of repetitive elements, regulatory regions, and chromatin accessibility features flanking the breakpoint, consistent with known mechanisms of fusion gene formation. Functionally, the ASAP1::BRAF fusion is predicted to emphasize constitutive MAPK pathway activation via dimer-dependent BRAF signaling, analogous to canonical BRAF fusions and mechanistically distinct from BRAF V600E mutations. Clinically, BRAF fusion-driven tumors are typically resistant to first-generation BRAF inhibitors but may be sensitive to MEK inhibitors or emerging type II RAF inhibitors that effectively target RAF dimers. Although no adjuvant therapy was required following complete resection, documentation of this fusion provides a rational framework for future molecularly guided treatment should disease recurrence occur. This case expands the spectrum of oncogenic BRAF fusion partners in LGG and underscores the importance of integrated RNA-based diagnostics and computational validation in precision neuro-oncology.","92":"Autophagy, a key lysosomal degradation pathway regulating metabolic adaptation in cancer, plays fundamental roles in both the tumor and host stromal compartments during cancer progression. An important unanswered question is whether and how autophagy in specific host stromal elements, such as endothelial cells, influences metastasis. Here, we scrutinize how the genetic loss of autophagy in endothelial cells impacts primary tumor progression and metastasis in the Polyoma Middle T ( <i>PyMT<\/i> ) model of luminal B breast cancer. In both autochthonous and orthotopic mammary transplant models, <i>PyMT<\/i> primary tumor growth is significantly delayed upon endothelial cell Atg12 or Atg5 genetic deletion ( <i>Atg12 or 5<\/i> ECKO), which correlates with increased tumor cell apoptosis and HIF1\u03b1 activation. In contrast, <i>PyMT<\/i> -bearing <i>Atg12<\/i> ECKO mice exhibit increased metastasis, as well as higher rates of primary tumor and lung metastatic recurrence following surgical resection of <i>PyMT<\/i> primary tumors. Experimental metastasis assays further corroborate that loss of endothelial cell autophagy in <i>Atg12<\/i> ECKO host animals promotes PyMT metastatic colonization and outgrowth, resulting in increased lung metastases compared to controls. Similarly, in the Rat Insulin Promoter T antigen pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (RT2-PNET) model, endothelial cell deletion of <i>Atg12<\/i> promotes liver micro-metastases. Taken together, these results from distinct preclinical cancer models reveal that endothelial cell autophagy suppresses metastatic seeding and progression and broach that autophagy inhibition in host endothelial cells may adversely influence the efficacy of systemic autophagy-lysosomal pathway inhibition in the clinical oncology setting.","93":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR<\/i>) exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations account for 5-12% of <i>EGFR<\/i>-mutated non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and are generally resistant to first- and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Among these, the A763_Y764insFQEA variant represents a rare, structurally distinct subtype that demonstrates sensitivity to multiple EGFR-TKIs. However, clinical evidence in Asian populations remains limited. A 63-year-old Japanese woman with stage IVB lung adenocarcinoma [programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score 70%] received multiple lines of systemic therapy, including pembrolizumab-based chemoimmunotherapy, docetaxel plus ramucirumab, and subsequent cytotoxic regimens. Initial polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based <i>EGFR<\/i> testing was negative. After disease progression through fourth-line treatment, plasma-based comprehensive genomic profiling using FoundationOne<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> Liquid identified the <i>EGFR<\/i> A763_Y764insFQEA variant. Osimertinib (80 mg daily) was initiated as fifth-line therapy, achieving a partial response by two months and disease control lasting approximately five months. Treatment continued beyond radiographic progression based on clinical benefit, with an overall survival of 10 months following osimertinib initiation. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic significance of liquid biopsy in detecting rare but actionable <i>EGFR<\/i> variants. The A763_Y764insFQEA mutation is uniquely sensitive to EGFR-TKIs, and comprehensive molecular testing can guide effective targeted therapy even in later treatment lines. Broader implementation of hybrid-capture-based assays may improve precision oncology outcomes for patients with rare <i>EGFR<\/i> alterations.","94":"The combination of an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin (platinum-etoposide) has become the first-line treatment for patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Although previous studies have examined the relationship between geriatric assessments and treatment efficacy, the association with treatment tolerability in elderly patients with ES-SCLC remains insufficiently understood. We aimed to evaluate the association between low body mass index (BMI)-a component of geriatric assessment-and treatment tolerability. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients aged \u226565 years with ES-SCLC who received anti-PD-L1 antibody plus platinum-etoposide at a single center between August 2019 and April 2024. Tolerability was defined as the completion of four cycles of anti-PD-L1 antibody combined with platinum-etoposide. We also assessed treatment efficacy and safety profiles. A total of 71 patients were included, with a median age of 73 years (range: 65-91 years). Of these, 51 patients (72%) were male, and 54 (76%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) of 0 or 1. Sixteen patients (23%) showed a low BMI (<19 kg\/m2), whereas 55 (77%) showed a non-low BMI. Tolerability was achieved in 8 patients (50%) with low BMI compared with 44 patients (80%) with non-low BMI. There were no significant differences in overall survival, progression-free survival, or the incidence of grade \u22653 adverse events among the two groups. In multivariate analysis, low BMI and ECOG-PS \u22652 were independently associated with reduced treatment tolerability [odds ratio (OR): 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06-0.88, P=0.03; OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.04-0.48, P<0.01, respectively]. Low BMI and poor performance status were independently associated with decreased tolerability to anti-PD-L1 antibody combined with platinum-etoposide in elderly patients with ES-SCLC. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating geriatric assessments into treatment decision-making for this population.","95":"Precision oncology in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) requires comprehensive genomic characterization to inform therapeutic decisions. However, the spectrum of genomic alterations and their co-mutation patterns, particularly in relation to immunotherapy biomarkers, remains incompletely understood. This study investigated the associations between driver gene alterations and clinicopathological characteristics, and characterized co-mutation patterns in relation to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) levels. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 431 NSCLC patients, utilizing a comprehensive pan-solid tumor next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel covering 654 genes to characterize genomic alterations. Clinicopathological characteristics were systematically collected and analyzed to identify significant differences across various mutational profiles. Systematic assessments were performed to evaluate interactions between co-mutations and PD-L1 expression as well as TMB. Genomic profiling revealed <i>EGFR<\/i> as the most frequently mutated driver gene (59.1%), followed by <i>TP53<\/i> (39.7%), <i>RBM10<\/i> (14.6%), <i>MUC16<\/i> (12.7%), and <i>KRAS<\/i> (10.0%). <i>EGFR<\/i> mutations showed a strong female predominance (P<0.001), whereas <i>MUC16<\/i> (P=0.004) and <i>KRAS<\/i> (P<0.001) alterations were more common in males. <i>TP53<\/i> (P=0.005) and <i>KRAS<\/i> (P<0.001) alterations were more frequently found in smokers. Patients with advanced disease stages exhibited higher frequencies of <i>TP53<\/i> mutations (P<0.001), contrasting with the predominance of <i>EGFR<\/i> (P<0.001) and <i>RBM10<\/i> (P=0.04) mutations in early-stage tumors. <i>TP53<\/i> co-mutations were the most common types, especially <i>TP53<\/i>-<i>EGFR<\/i> and <i>TP53<\/i>-<i>KRAS<\/i> co-mutations. <i>TP53<\/i>-<i>EGFR<\/i> co-mutations had higher PD-L1 expression (P=0.03) and TMB level (P=0.03) than <i>EGFR<\/i>-only mutations. Patients with <i>TP53<\/i>-<i>KRAS<\/i> co-mutations showed significantly higher PD-L1 expression (P=0.01) and TMB level (P=0.01) than <i>KRAS<\/i>-only mutations. This study underscores the diverse genetic mutations occurring in NSCLC patients with varying risk factors. The identification of <i>TP53<\/i> co-mutations provides critical insights for personalized immunotherapeutic strategies and optimizing treatment outcomes.","96":"Pediatric supportive care trials frequently rely on analyses of multiple clinically relevant outcomes, posing challenges for overall trial interpretation. Hierarchical composite endpoints (HCEs) rank relevant outcomes by prespecified clinical importance and offer potential advantages such as harmonizing trial conclusions. We reanalyzed two randomized supportive care trials utilizing post-hoc HCE, each conducted through the Children's Oncology Group. ACCL0934 evaluated levofloxacin for prevention of bloodstream infection (BSI) in patients with acute leukemia (AL) or undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and was chosen because of observed multidimensional benefits of levofloxacin. ACCL0431 evaluated sodium thiosulfate (STS) for prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss. ACCL0431 analyses were performed for overall and localized disease subgroups, chosen due to conflicting effect directionality on hearing vs survival by cohort. We estimated treatment effects on HCEs using win-odds ratios (WO). For ACCL0934, the primary HCE included death, severe infection, BSI, and neutropenic fever. For ACCL0431, the HCE included death, relapse\/progression, and hearing loss. In ACCL0934, levofloxacin reduced BSI incidence, but only with corresponding p-value <0.05 in the AL cohort (22% vs 43% on control; <i>P<\/i> =0.003; HCT: 11% versus 17% on control; <i>P=<\/i> 0.06). Using HCE reanalysis, the estimated win-odds achieved statistical significance in both cohorts (AL: WO=1.74, <i>P=<\/i> 0.002; HCT: WO=1.28, <i>P=<\/i> 0.031). In ACCL0431, HCE analyses resulted in an estimated null effect (WO=1) in the overall cohort but resulted in beneficial effects (WO>1) for analyses of the localized cohort. HCEs can provide a harmonized framework for interpreting complex supportive care trials by integrating outcomes of varying clinical importance. These post-hoc analyses should not be used to reinterpret either trial but motivate consideration of prospective use of HCE going forward.","97":"Children with neuromuscular and syndromic disorders are among the most medically fragile patients in pediatric spine care. Conditions such as cerebral palsy, myelomeningocele, spinal muscular atrophy, neurofibromatosis type 1, Marfan syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome carry a high risk of early-onset scoliosis during critical periods of thoracic and pulmonary development. In these populations, scoliosis is rarely an isolated problem; it reflects the cumulative burden of neurologic impairment, connective tissue fragility, cardiopulmonary compromise, nutritional deficiency, and systemic disease. This review highlights the clinical and surgical challenges unique to each condition while emphasizing the central role of multidisciplinary care. In cerebral palsy, scoliosis risk correlates with motor severity and is compounded by respiratory and nutritional compromise. In myelomeningocele, neurosurgical and urologic coordination is essential given the prevalence of shunt dependence, Chiari malformation, tethered cord, and neurogenic bladder. In spinal muscular atrophy, perioperative pathways center on airway clearance, noninvasive ventilation, and nutritional optimization. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is distinguished by dystrophic scoliosis and dural ectasia, requiring advanced imaging and tailored instrumentation, while families often seek broader clinic support from genetics, oncology, and ophthalmology. In Marfan syndrome, connective tissue fragility complicates fixation, and combined management with cardiology and chest wall specialists is often required. For Prader-Willi syndrome, obesity, endocrine dysfunction, and severe sleep apnea demand careful optimization. Evidence demonstrates that standardized multidisciplinary pathways shorten hospitalizations, reduce pulmonary and infectious complications, and improve consistency of care. Beyond measurable outcomes, families report greater trust and satisfaction when diverse specialties are integrated. Together, these findings reinforce that optimal management of neuromuscular and syndromic scoliosis depends not only on surgical expertise, but also on coordinated, comprehensive, and lifelong care.","98":"Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer related mortality due to delayed diagnosis and limited therapeutic efficiency. Early detection and effective immune modulation are important to control lung cancer. Advancements in nanotechnology have improved oncology due to sensitive, specific, and minimally invasive detection platforms along with immune regulatory therapeutic approaches. Smart nanoplatforms fabricated with high precision and responsiveness have the ability to treat diseases as well as the immune system. These systems combine functional nanomaterials with biomolecular recognition elements to detect biomarkers such as exosomes, DNA, RNA, and proteins. They also facilitate targeted immune activation through checkpoint inhibition, nanovaccines, and tumor microenvironment reprogramming. Moreover, artificial intelligence and machine learning are enhancing the interpretation of complex data, which increases the diagnostic accuracy and predictive power. Despite advances in diagnostic and immune modulation, there are also several challenges related to biological barriers and biocompatibility. This review comprehensively explains the molecular basis of lung cancer, recent progress in nanotechnology based diagnostics and immunotherapy, and the design of multifunctional smart nanoplatforms. Future studies emphasize integrating personalized medicine, digital modeling, and bioinspired nanosystems for clinically translatable solutions in early lung cancer management.","99":"Bevacizumab (BVZ) is an anti-vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A monoclonal antibody (mAb) widely used in oncology and ophthalmology indications globally. Accurate quantification of mAbs in biological fluids is an essential prerequisite for determining pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters to assess the relationship between drug exposure and response. We developed and evaluated PK assays for BVZ in human serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) immunoassay platforms to assess sensitivity and performance. The ELISA method, employing a Streptavidin-Biotin detection system with anti-idiotypic antibodies, demonstrated five times greater sensitivity than the conventional horseradish peroxidase-based ELISA format. The validated PK bridging ELISA achieved a quantification range of 10-220\u202fng\/mL, extendable to 5000\u202fng\/mL via dilution. In contrast, the MSD assay utilized electrochemiluminescence detection with Sulfo Tag labeling, offering a 20-fold higher sensitivity and detecting BVZ at concentrations as low as 500\u202fpg\/mL. This parallel evaluation concluded that ELISA is suitable for routine PK analysis due to its robustness and cost-efficiency. At the same time, MSD is advantageous for detecting BVZ at low concentrations in early-phase clinical trials and ophthalmic applications where serum levels are minimal."},"url":{"0":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667944\/","1":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667943\/","2":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667886\/","3":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667851\/","4":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667793\/","5":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667790\/","6":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667751\/","7":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667699\/","8":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667388\/","9":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667348\/","10":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667341\/","11":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667310\/","12":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667298\/","13":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667242\/","14":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666355\/","15":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666294\/","16":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665950\/","17":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665935\/","18":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665865\/","19":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665857\/","20":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665824\/","21":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665782\/","22":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665759\/","23":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665737\/","24":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665719\/","25":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665682\/","26":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665530\/","27":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665185\/","28":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665110\/","29":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664952\/","30":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664938\/","31":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664815\/","32":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664773\/","33":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664736\/","34":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664705\/","35":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664622\/","36":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664597\/","37":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664562\/","38":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664285\/","39":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664164\/","40":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664142\/","41":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664039\/","42":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663858\/","43":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663831\/","44":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663830\/","45":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663806\/","46":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663756\/","47":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663669\/","48":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663540\/","49":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663278\/","50":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663276\/","51":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663274\/","52":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663218\/","53":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663179\/","54":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663058\/","55":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663007\/","56":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662989\/","57":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662929\/","58":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662612\/","59":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662597\/","60":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662428\/","61":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662336\/","62":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662190\/","63":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662178\/","64":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41661969\/","65":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41661569\/","66":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41661474\/","67":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41661400\/","68":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41661399\/","69":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41661366\/","70":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41661178\/","71":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41661089\/","72":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660936\/","73":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660932\/","74":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660930\/","75":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660929\/","76":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660902\/","77":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660707\/","78":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660702\/","79":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660448\/","80":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660367\/","81":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660331\/","82":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660271\/","83":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660253\/","84":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660241\/","85":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660142\/","86":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660127\/","87":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660122\/","88":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660121\/","89":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41659965\/","90":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41659839\/","91":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41659712\/","92":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41659580\/","93":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41659272\/","94":"http
