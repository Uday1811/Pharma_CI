Therefore, we took stimuli-organism-response (SOR) as our framework to comprehensively consider the effects of internal and external factors and to clarify the chain evolution process of stimulus panic-buying behavior. Second, based on an improved infectious disease model using the Markov chain and combined with cellular automata methods, we studied the spatiotemporal evolution of group panic-buying behavior. Specifically, we focused on the evolutionary process of panic-buying across temporal sequences and within macroscopic geographical spaces such as urban communities. Our simulations yielded compelling insights: (1) the intensity of panic-buying information has a significant stimulating effect on panic-buying behavior. Interestingly, previous encounters with such buying experiences can act as a soothing balm, alleviating panic emotions. (2) The groups that participate in and stop buying both exhibit a clustered distribution in space, forming several clustered buying areas in space. Individuals at the center of the buying area often participate in the buying first, while those at the edge are more likely to stop buying. (3) Partition control implemented in the buying area can help mitigate the cascading effects of fear-driven purchasing behavior and increase its rate of decline. In addition, we also verified the effectiveness of the model using a case study in China, and discuss the model's theoretical and practical significance, limitations, and future research directions.","1":"The dual crises of antimicrobial resistance and cancer demand innovative therapeutic platforms that overcome conventional treatment limitations. This study uniquely combines systematic Box-Behnken optimization of green-synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles from Thymus vulgaris with comprehensive evaluation of their synergistic antimicrobial and anticancer activities. HPLC profiling identified quercetin (55.92%), chlorogenic acid (15.33%), and gallic acid (12.28%) as principal phytochemical reducing and capping agents. Statistical optimization (R<sup>2<\/sup>\u2009=\u20090.9886) established copper acetate concentration (F\u2009=\u2009670.48, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and incubation time (F\u2009=\u2009124.11, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) as critical synthesis determinants, yielding monodisperse spherical nanoparticles (19-25 nm TEM; Z-average 119.2 nm, PDI 0.22; \u03b6-potential\u2009-\u200945.8 mV). XRD confirmed a crystalline monoclinic CuO phase, while FTIR validated phytochemical surface functionalization. TE-CuONPs exhibited concentration-dependent bactericidal activity (MIC 250-950 \u03bcg\/mL; MBC\/MIC\u2009\u2264\u20090.58) against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis as well as inhibition of biofilm formation in\u00a0S. aureus\u00a0and\u00a0P. aeruginosa, with BIC\u2085\u2080 of 299 and 315 \u03bcg\/mL, respectively. Critically, checkerboard assays revealed strong synergy with gentamicin (FICI 0.13-0.28), achieving eightfold dose reduction for both agents against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Time-kill kinetics demonstrated accelerated bacterial eradication, with combination therapy achieving\u2009\u2265\u20093-log\u2081\u2080 reduction 8-12 h faster than monotherapies, a clinically significant advantage for acute infections. Furthermore, TE-CuONPs showed moderate antiproliferative activity (IC\u2085\u2080\u2009=\u2009117.26 \u03bcg\/mL) against MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with limited selectivity over normal fibroblasts (SI\u2009=\u20091.85), representing a sixfold enhancement over the crude extract. Additionally, Flow cytometric analysis revealed profound apoptotic induction, with 77.25% of cancer cells undergoing cell death (29.73% early apoptosis, 47.52% late apoptosis\/necrosis). DPPH radical scavenging (IC\u2085\u2080\u2009=\u200955 \u03bcg\/mL) demonstrated a threefold superior antioxidant capacity versus plant extract alone. These findings advance the reproducible botanical nanoparticle synthesis and translational potential of plant-mediated nanomedicine for infectious disease management.","2":"Young children and children living with HIV are at high risk of progressing to tuberculosis (TB) disease following <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<\/i> (<i>Mtb<\/i>) exposure and infection, and also of developing severe forms of disease and TB-related mortality. Identifying children who have very early (sub-clinical) TB disease, prior to progression to clinically apparent TB, would mean that TB preventive treatment (TPT) could be more efficiently targeted to this group. Identifying biomarker changes on drug therapy in children with <i>Mtb<\/i> infection or very early disease could pave the way for the development of tests that can identify which children have viable bacilli and are therefore at increased risk of disease progression. The INTREPID study will use already collected samples taken from well-phenotyped paediatric cohorts in three clinical studies conducted in South Africa in children <5 years, including a drug-resistant TPT trial (TB-CHAMP), an observational household contact study (interferon-gamma release assay studies) and a prospective diagnostic study (Umoya), all conducted in a setting with a high burden of TB and HIV. We will employ transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and serology approaches to analyse changes in host blood profiles at every stage along the TB continuum, from <i>Mtb<\/i> exposure to disease and from children treated for <i>Mtb<\/i> infection and early TB disease, as well as targeted <i>Mtb<\/i> antibody analysis. Data on viral co-infections and relevant clinical and epidemiological parameters will be integrated and evaluated to identify the optimal biosignatures that can predict future progression to clinically overt disease in children below 5 years of age, including those living with HIV. The study protocol received ethical approval from the Stellenbosch University Health Research Ethics Committee (N23\/03\/025). The study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, scientific conferences and formal presentations to healthcare professionals and to local communities, in collaboration with the Desmond Tutu TB Centre Community Advisory Board.","3":"Disease ecology has focused greatly on determining how changes to biodiversity may drive infectious disease risk for humans. Fencing off experimental areas (exclosures) has been a common experimental approach to assess how removing large-bodied hosts may affect disease risk, especially with tick-borne pathogens (TBPs). However, exclosure experiments have found conflicting results based on the experiment's scale, with smaller exclosures tending to increase tick densities inside the exclosure and larger exclosures tending to decrease tick densities inside. Previously, we have lacked a unifying theoretical framework able to reconcile the results of exclosure experiments across spatial scales. We present a spatially explicit model of TBP risk incorporating tick dispersal by small transmission-competent mammal hosts who can enter the exclosure and by large transmission-incompetent mammal hosts excluded from the exclosure. Our model reproduces the scale-dependence and spatial patterning observed in past exclosure experiments while elucidating their causal mechanisms. Specifically, the modeled exclosures produce high densities of infected ticks near their boundaries, with the densities decreasing towards the exclosure's centre. Empirical results have found lower tick densities at the exclosure's edge than its centre, a pattern we demonstrate can also be produced if we additionally allow ticks in their free-living questing stage to disperse.","4":"Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis (PDAP) is a common and severe complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), and it constitutes a major cause of PD treatment failure and patient mortality. The most common organisms causing PDAP are Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp, Escherichia. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although conventional anti-infective therapy can lead to the recovery of most cases, 10% to 20% of patients still progress to refractory peritonitis (RP). Query fever (Q fever), a zoonotic disease, caused by Coxiella burnetii, is an infectious disease that has long been considered a rare and regionally restricted disease. It can be responsible for hepatitis, pneumonia,endocarditis, endovascular infections, and so on. However, Q fever is rarely considered a cause of PDAP. Herein, we report a case of a 29-year-old male with Q fever presenting as peritoneal dialysis-related refractory peritonitis (PDRP). The patient received a combination therapy regimen based on doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, and rifampicin, and was discharged after achieving clinical improvement.","5":"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers are hot spots for infectious disease spread, as manifested during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mpox cases among ICE detainees during the 2022 global outbreak were investigated and a Freedom of Information Act request for mpox testing data from January to November 2022 was submitted, focusing on demographic and clinical information. Seven detainees across five facilities in Texas, Arizona, and New Jersey were tested. Two detainees tested positive, revealing a 28.6% positivity rate. One detainee received antiviral treatment. Overall, few migrant detainees have been evaluated for mpox. The limited number of mpox tests suggest that additional cases of mpox may have been missed. Adequate resources for mpox testing, treatment, and prevention within detention facilities are critical to limit spread among migrants.","6":"Predicting host-pathogen protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is a cornerstone of modern infectious disease research, offering unparalleled insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying infection and immune evasion. Despite its transformative potential, the field faces persistent challenges, including limited experimental data, class imbalance, and the dynamic evolution of pathogens. The current study explores cutting-edge computational approaches that have redefined host-pathogen protein-protein interaction (HP-PPI) prediction. Notably, transfer learning has emerged as a game changer, enabling models to leverage knowledge from well-characterized systems to predict interactions in previously underexplored pathogens. Hybrid and ensemble models have proven highly effective, combining the strengths of diverse algorithms to capture the complexity of biological interactions. Explainable AI tools are now bridging the gap between computational predictions and biological interpretability, offering actionable insights into key interaction drivers. Additionally, the review discusses advanced data integration techniques, such as multi-omics fusion and graph-based learning, which explore new dimensions in HP-PPI research. This synthesis of challenges, solutions, and future perspectives highlights a paradigm shift in computational biology, in which scalable, interpretable, and biologically informed models pave the way for breakthroughs in therapeutic discovery, vaccine development, and precision medicine. Our review sets the stage for future advancements, emphasizing the potential of next-generation technologies to unravel the intricate dance between hosts and pathogens.","7":"Infectious diseases remain a global health challenge, driven by increasing antimicrobial-resistance and the threat of emerging epidemics. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus are leading causes of mortality worldwide. Trained immunity-a form of innate immune memory-offers a promising approach to enhance pathogen clearance. Here, we demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 induces trained immunity in human monocytes through a mechanism involving mTORC1 activation, glutaminolysis, and epigenetic remodeling. Macrophages derived from IFN-\u03b3-trained monocytes exhibited increased glycolytic activity with enhanced cytokine and chemokine responses upon stimulation or infection. Crucially, trained macrophages had increased production of reactive oxygen species which mediated enhanced bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Furthermore, ATAC-sequencing analysis of IFN-\u03b3 trained macrophages revealed increased chromatin accessibility in regions associated with host defence. Lastly, IFN-\u03b3 training restored impaired innate responses in macrophages from individuals homozygous for the TIRAP 180L polymorphism, a genetic variant associated with increased susceptibility to infection. These findings establish IFN-\u03b3 as a potent inducer of trained immunity in human monocytes and support its potential as a host-directed strategy to strengthen antimicrobial defenses, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals and high-risk clinical contexts.","8":"An integrated microfluidic platform has been developed for the efficient generation of highly uniform alginate hydrogel microspheres (AHMs) encapsulating HeLa cells, enabling robust three dimensional (3D) cell culture and subsequent infection with Coxsackievirus B3 expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (CVB3-eGFP). Our results demonstrate that AHMs support high cell viability and facilitated cell proliferation within a biomimetic 3D matrix. By systematically reducing the alginate concentration from 1.0% to 0.6%, we enhanced viral accessibility while maintaining microstructural integrity, thereby significantly improving CVB3-eGFP infection rates, as confirmed by fluorescence imaging and western blot analysis. This study establishes a tunable, reproducible, and physiologically relevant 3D model for studying virus-host interactions, with broad applications in antiviral drug screening and infectious disease modeling.","9":"<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae<\/i> poses a substantial health concern worldwide, with high mortality often associated with its elevated resistance levels. Combination antibiotic therapies have emerged as a viable strategy for addressing infections caused by these highly resistant pathogens, yet the evolutionary routes to resistance under such regimens remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated how resistance can emerge during exposure to combination therapy by conducting an in vitro evolutionary experiment with a clinical <i>K. pneumoniae<\/i> KPC-producing isolate (KP03, Brazil), which was initially susceptible to both amikacin and polymyxin B (AmkPol). While the combination therapy displayed an additive effect in vitro, subinhibitory exposure rapidly drove resistance. In three independent lineages, bacteria tolerated concentrations nearly 10-fold (polymyxin B) and 5-fold (amikacin) above EuCAST breakpoints, with MICs reaching 128-256 \u03bcg\u00b7mL<sup>-1<\/sup> after 45 passages. These high resistance levels persisted for at least 10 days without selective pressure, although resistance lineages exhibited measurable fitness costs. Whole-genome sequencing revealed diverse mutations affecting <i>lapB<\/i>, <i>phoP<\/i>, <i>rho<\/i>, <i>smbA<\/i>, <i>mlaA<\/i>, and <i>asmA<\/i>, while transcriptomics analysis showed upregulation of the <i>arn<\/i> operon and the <i>aphA<\/i> alongside with downregulation of envelope- and efflux-associated genes. Cross-resistance was also observed against colistin and certain antimicrobial peptides, raising concern for treatment options beyond the AmkPol combination. Although combination therapy represents an important treatment strategy, our findings demonstrate that <i>K. penumoniae<\/i> can rapidly evolve stable, high-level resistance under combination therapy, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of how such regimens influence resistance development and the continued need to develop novel antibiotics strategies.","10":"Communities worldwide face unprecedented challenges from climate-related disasters, infectious disease outbreaks, and persistent health inequities. However, no systematic review has synthesized evidence on nurse-led interventions specifically designed to build community resilience. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of nurse-led community resilience-building interventions across different community types, intervention modalities, and outcome measures. A systematic review following Preferred Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted across three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) from database inception through September 2025. Studies evaluating nurse-led interventions to build community resilience were included. Two independent reviewers conducted study selection and data extraction. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane RoB-2 and ROBINS-I tools. Narrative synthesis was performed due to substantial methodological and clinical heterogeneity across included studies, with structured categorization by population, intervention, and outcome measures. Six studies from different countries were included, with sample sizes ranging from 42 to 328 participants. Interventions included resilience workshops, social engagement programs, disaster preparedness training, and school-based leadership initiatives. Nurse-led interventions showed significant improvements in psychological resilience, preparedness knowledge and capacity, quality of life, and stress reduction related to acculturation. Community resilience interventions led by nurses demonstrated positive, significant impacts on resilience, preparedness, and related psychosocial outcomes. Nurses are well-positioned to lead capacity development due to their accessibility, community trust, and expertise in health promotion.","11":"This review aimed to evaluate the impact of school-based hand hygiene interventions on infectious disease outcomes in school populations. A PROSPERO registered review (CRD42024620293) followed by Cochrane methodology MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and ERIC formed the databases that received the search. The study included English-language research from 2014 to the present that examined school children in educational settings with quantifiable hand hygiene-disease relationships. The screening process and appraisal followed the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist. The search produced 4345 records from which 33 studies qualified for inclusion. The interventions included educational programmes and handwashing facilities together with hand sanitiser distribution and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes that combined multiple components. Education-only interventions reduced upper respiratory infection-related absences by up to 50%. Soap and water handwashing combined with sanitiser reduced acute gastroenteritis absences by 36%. Integrated WASH programmes lowered diarrhoea and respiratory illness absences. Parental involvement further enhanced effectiveness. Hand hygiene programmes are most effective when combining education, resources and behaviour change. Their success depends on context, infrastructure and delivery. While reducing disease and absenteeism, challenges like dermatitis and non-compliance remain. Tailored, inclusive approaches and policy-level investment are needed to ensure sustainable, evidence-based impact in schools.","12":"Cynomolgus macaques, a species of Old World primate native to southeastern and eastern Asia and the island of Mauritius, are one of the most important nonhuman primate models for infectious disease. Although the closely related rhesus macaque is classified into subspecies based on geographic origin, no such subdivision exists for cynomolgus macaques, and they continue to be used interchangeably in infectious disease research, reducing the comparability of data produced from these studies. Research into the population genetics of cynomolgus macaques has found significant differences between macaques native to different areas, including their genetic diversity, with macaques from insular populations such as Mauritius and the Philippines exhibiting highly restricted heterozygosity compared to mainland populations native to Indonesia or Cambodia. In the context of infectious disease studies, research into pathogens, including Ebola virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis have found differences in study outcomes, survival times, and immune cell responses between different populations of macaques. This review provides an overview of the differences between cynomolgus macaque populations in the context of genetic diversity, and in response to infection, and highlights the need for clear reporting of geographic origin of primates used in research. This will improve data comparison between studies and help to further refine this important animal model.","13":"Plasmablast-derived HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) and structural basis for binding to native HBsAg are poorly known. We aimed to identify plasmablast-derived HBsAg-specific mAbs, evaluate their antiviral activities and resolve their structure for binding to native HBsAg. A previously vaccinated volunteer was enrolled in this study, who was boosted with a dose of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine and donated the blood sample. Activated plasmablasts were sorted from fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mAbs were expressed. Their gene features, cross-genotypic binding activities and antiviral functions in vitro and in vivo were comprehensively analysed. The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) was used to determine the structure of representative mAb bound to the native HBsAg. In this study, we cloned a series of HBsAg-specific mAbs directly from clonally expanded plasmablasts from a vaccinated individual. Most of the mAbs displayed cross-reactivities of binding to different genotype HBsAg proteins and antiviral functions such as neutralisation and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. These human anti-HBsAg mAbs, especially SY-4-class and SY-23-class, could be good candidates for antibody drugs. The cryo-EM structure of SY-23 bound to the dimeric HBsAg was determined, revealing its binding mechanism and unprecedented structural detail of the major antigenic loop (AGL) of HBsAg. Overall, our work has uncovered the diverse gene features and varied anti-HBV activities of plasmablast-derived mAbs, providing a series of antibody drug candidates and the long-sought-after atomic model of AGL has paved the way for a wholistic characterisation of the AGL's dynamic conformation during HBV infection and immune response.","14":"No abstract available","15":"Nocardiosis, an infectious disease most commonly caused by the nosocomial pathogen Nocardia asteroides, predominantly affects immunosuppressed individuals and often presents as a pulmonary infection transmitted through inhalation. Although initial drugs like sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole were used, their poor tissue penetration and the requirement for prolonged therapy have led to their exclusion from current treatment regimens. Consequently, there is a growing demand for novel therapeutics to suppress the pathogenic activity of N. asteroides. The pathogenic strain NCTC11293 of N. asteroides demonstrated a high completeness level of 98.19% in the CheckM analysis, with PGAP annotation identifying 6485 proteins. Given its clinical relevance and resistance profile, the NOCAP analysis revealed glycosyltransferase as a potential drug target associated with drug resistance and pathogenicity. The predicted and validated structure of the glycosyltransferase protein (accession WP_019050588.1) was subjected to structure-based virtual screening using the Schr\u00f6dinger Suite against marine and phytochemical databases, including CMNPD, SWMD and IMPPAT. This multi-tier screening identified four promising hit molecules: CMNPD1518, CMNPD23345, SWMDGA001, and IMPY466077. The docking scores and MM-GBSA binding energies ranged from -7.20 to -8.90\u00a0kcal\/mol and -49.81 to -59.90\u00a0kcal\/mol, respectively. These hit molecules adhered to Lipinski's Rule of Five and exhibited accepted pharmacokinetic properties, along with balanced electronic structural characteristics, illustrating their higher reactivity and stability. Molecular dynamics (MD), essential dynamics (ED) analyses, including PCA-based FEL, and DSSP assessments reinforced the structural stability of the glycosyltransferase-phytochemical complexes. These computational findings suggest that the identified molecules represent promising therapeutic candidates for the treatment of nocardiosis.","16":"Peri-implantitis is a biofilm-induced inflammatory disease that compromises peri-implant tissues, adversely affecting human health and implant survival. As an infectious disease, its management through mechanical debridement alone is often limited by persistent microbial burden. Adjunctive probiotic therapy, grounded in contemporary medicine, has therefore been proposed to improve peri-implant health and oral wellbeing, with potential relevance to broader public health outcomes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of subgingival probiotic delivery as an adjunct to mechanical debridement in the non-surgical management of peri-implantitis. A prospective clinical study was conducted involving 52 systemically and periodontally healthy individuals aged 30-60 years with peri-implantitis. Participants were randomly divided into two groups (n = 26 each). Group 1 received mechanical debridement alone, while Group 2 received mechanical debridement combined with subgingival application of Lactobacillus reuteri probiotic. Clinical parameters (PI, GI, PPD, and CAL) and Porphyromonas gingivalis levels were assessed at baseline and three months. RT-PCR was used for microbiological evaluation. Data were analyzed using paired and independent t-tests, with P < 0.05 considered significant. Both groups showed significant intra-group improvements in clinical and microbiological parameters (P < 0.05). However, Group 2 exhibited significantly greater reductions in PI, GI, PPD, CAL, and P. gingivalis levels compared with Group 1 (P = 0.00), demonstrating the superior effectiveness of probiotic therapy. Adjunctive probiotic therapy significantly improves clinical outcomes and reduces microbial load in peri-implantitis patients, offering a beneficial addition to mechanical debridement.","17":"Peri-implant diseases such as peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis adversely affect human health and oral wellbeing, posing a notable public health challenge, particularly in patients with a history of generalized chronic periodontitis. These biofilm-mediated inflammatory conditions represent an infectious disease process that can progress to peri-implant disease and functional illness if not managed appropriately. Early identification and timely intervention, guided by principles of preventive medicine, during the post-restorative maintenance phase are essential for long-term implant success. This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis one year after prosthetic loading in patients with previously treated generalized chronic periodontitis, maintained on regular supportive periodontal therapy (SPT). The study included patients aged 30-60 years with a history of generalized chronic periodontitis who had undergone full-mouth periodontal flap surgery and were compliant with SPT for at least one-year post-implant prosthetic loading. Peri-implant conditions were diagnosed according to the 2017 AAP\/EFP classification criteria. Data from 403 patients and 679 implants were analyzed using SPSS 23.0 to determine prevalence rates at both patient and implant levels. Among 403 patients (44.9% female, 55.1% male), 55.6% exhibited peri-implant health, 28.5% had peri-implant mucositis, and 15.9% showed peri-implantitis. At the implant level, 73.8% of the 679 implants were healthy, while 15.2% had mucositis and 11.0% had peri-implantitis. In a high-risk population with a history of generalized chronic periodontitis and adherence to supportive periodontal therapy, peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis were prevalent one-year post-loading. These findings underscore the importance of rigorous monitoring and tailored maintenance protocols to prevent peri-implant disease progression in susceptible patients.","18":"Peri-implantitis is a biofilm-induced inflammatory disease that jeopardizes dental implant longevity and human health. As an infectious disease, its incomplete resolution with mechanical debridement alone necessitates adjunctive approaches. Systemic probiotics, within modern medicine, offer antimicrobial and immunomodulatory benefits that may enhance peri-implant health and oral wellbeing, with relevance to broader public health. To evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of systemic probiotic supplementation as an adjunct to mechanical debridement in the treatment of peri-implantitis. This prospective clinical study included 50 systemically healthy patients diagnosed with peri-implantitis. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups: Group 1 (n = 25) received mechanical debridement with placebo, while Group 2 (n = 25) received mechanical debridement combined with systemic probiotic supplementation for 30 days. Clinical parameters including Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and microbial load (CFU\/mL) were evaluated at baseline and after one month. Both groups showed significant improvements from baseline to one month (p < 0.05); however, Group 2 demonstrated superior outcomes. At one month, Group 2 showed lower PI (0.48 \u00b1 0.22), GI (0.52 \u00b1 0.09), PPD (2.78 \u00b1 0.11 mm), CAL (3.02 \u00b1 0.07 mm), and microbial load (0.49 \u00b1 0.02 \u0215 103 CFU\/mL) compared to Group 1 (p = 0.00 for all parameters). Systemic probiotics, when used as an adjunct to mechanical debridement, significantly improve clinical and microbiological outcomes in peri-implantitis management. This combination may offer a synergistic approach for enhanced therapeutic efficacy.","19":"The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 underwent several mutations since it was first identified in November 2021, with a large outbreak in Hong Kong in early 2022. Yet, local cases of Omicron infections persist, even though the COVID-19 pandemic ended in May 2023. This study aims to describe the changes in demographic and clinical characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 across different Omicron waves in Hong Kong and determine whether the changes continued into the postpandemic period. This retrospective repeated cross-sectional study collected data on patients infected with COVID-19 admitted to public hospitals in Hong Kong between May 1, 2022, and May 31, 2024. These data were later categorized into 3 periods based on the Omicron strain. A subsequent age-stratified descriptive analysis was conducted on each characteristic to identify any significant differences across the periods. First, the case fatality ratio significantly lowered among those older than 85 years (1.5% proportion decrease, period 1: 11.6%, period 2: 10.1%, effect size: 0.02; P<.001). Second, most patients were Chinese (\u226568.7% per age group and period), and females were predominantly infected for those aged older than 85 years (\u226556.9% per period). Third, the Charlson Comorbidity Index scores in most age groups showed a predominant proportion of infected individuals with 0 scores (more than 70% per period). Fourth, most cases were from slightly disadvantaged populations in Hong Kong (\u226530.5% per age group per period). Fifth, clinical management of Omicron hospitalizations showed lowered length of hospital stays among adults and older individuals (\u22651 d decrease between periods 1 and 3, per age group), as well as increased administration of bronchodilators. Despite the decreasing incidence of Omicron cases admitted to public hospitals in Hong Kong, the increasing case fatality ratio with age suggests that long-term surveillance of COVID-19 should be maintained to prepare for potential mutations and outbreaks.","20":"Fever is a common symptom of infectious diseases including for those with epidemic potential. Beyond malaria, the causes of undifferentiated (i.e., non-respiratory, non-diarrheal) acute febrile illnesses are not well characterized in Liberia. From December 2018 through March 2020, we established two acute febrile illness (AFI) sentinel surveillance sites in urban Monrovia at Redemption Hospital and Star of the Sea Health Centre, health facilities that were among the first to have Ebola cases during the 2014-2015 West Africa epidemic. Enrolled AFI patients were two (2) years of age or greater, had a measured fever of \u226537.5oC or history of fever within the past week, and without a known cause of fever. A standardized survey was administered to collect demographic, clinical characteristics, and risk factors. Whole blood was taken, nucleic acid material was extracted and ran on TaqMan Array Cards (TAC), a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing platform for 28 pathogens. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and multivariate regression models of any TAC detections stratified by site and age. We enrolled 1506 AFI patients, 1206 (80%) from Redemption Hospital and 300 (20%) from Star of the Sea. AFI patients were predominantly female (69%) and had a median (interquartile range) age of 18 (7-27) years. Among the 699 (46%) that were TAC positive, 627 were detected from Redemption Hospital and 72 were detected from Star of the Sea Health Centre. Overall Plasmodium spp. (malaria) (96%) were the majority of detections followed by dengue virus (2%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2%), and Rickettsia spp. (1%). We detected 19 co-infections [malaria co-infections (84%) being the most common]. Two pathogens with epidemic potential, Neisseria meningitidis (detected at Star of the Sea Health Centre) and Lassa virus (detected at Redemption Hospital), were also found. Patients with non-malaria TAC detections (n\u2009=\u200929) were higher at Star of the Sea Health Centre than Redemption Hospital (4% versus 1% respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.05). In multivariate regression for those ages 15 years and older at Redemption Hospital (adjusting for sex, age, pregnancy status, education, occupation, any medication use, measured fever at enrollment, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting\/nausea and joint pain), any medication use (aOR=0.6, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.4-0.9), measured fever at enrollment (aOR=3.5, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.1-12.0), headache (aOR=1.7, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.1-2.6 were statistically significant with any TAC detection. In multivariate regression for those ages 2-14 years at Redemption Hospital (adjusting for sex, age, abdominal pain, cough, vomiting\/nausea, runny nose, and any animal exposure), having abdominal pain (aOR=1.9, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.3-2.8), vomiting\/nausea (aOR=0.6, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.4-1.0), and any animal exposure (aOR=1.5, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.0-2.3) were statistically significant with any TAC detection. This is the first laboratory evidence of dengue and rickettsial disease in humans in Liberia. Liberia's incipient AFI platform was successful exploring causes of fever in emerging infections and detected circulating pathogens beyond malaria. AFI surveillance data can assist in the prioritization of public health diagnostic and clinical capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to emerging infectious disease threats in Liberia.","21":"Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have revolutionized vaccinology with their rapid development cycles and adaptability, yet their broad application is constrained by unresolved challenges in balancing mRNA structural stability and translational efficiency. Here, we introduce a groundbreaking multi-seed searching algorithm for mRNA codon optimization, an innovative framework that synergistically co-optimizes minimum free energy and codon adaptation index through adaptive integration of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. This novel approach enhances global search capability to escape local optima, a critical limitation of existing tools. Evaluations across long therapeutic mRNA sequences and short peptides (neoantigens from bladder cancer and melanoma) reveal our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art LinearDesign, delivering superior balanced improvements in both stability and translational efficiency validating its unique ability to navigate the inherent trade-offs between these two key metrics. Built on this algorithm, the Optiseed platform introduces transformative features including customizable scoring functions, flexible parameters for tailored optimization, and support for integrating untranslated regions (UTRs), poly(A) tails, and other elements to enable end-to-end vaccine construct design. This innovation addresses the rigidity of conventional tools, empowering precise, context-specific optimization. Optiseed represents a robust, scalable solution for mRNA vaccine codon optimization. Its superior performance across diverse sequences underscores its potential to accelerate mRNA-based therapeutic development, particularly in personalized cancer immunotherapy, while offering a framework adaptable for other applications such as infectious disease vaccine design.","22":"Psychological distress is a common occurrence among health workers during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet documented evidence on the scope of the challenge in faith-based healthcare organizations is scanty. Accordingly, this research used Lazarus and Folkman's Transactional Model to assess faith-based health workers' exposure to stressors during the outbreak of the Marburg Disease Virus in Ghana, the coping strategies adopted and psychological interventions employed to assist affected staff. A phenomenological study, involving 15 clinical and nonclinical healthcare workers from the Christian Health Association of Ghana, was conducted. Interviews were arranged virtually, and data analyzed with Braun and Clarke's (2006) thematic analysis. Participants revealed stress and mental health challenges during the Marburg disease outbreak, citing quarantine, fear of infection, and inadequate protective measures as stressors. Psychological impacts included insomnia, anxiety, and heightened health vigilance. Dissatisfaction arose from insufficient support and resources, such as isolation facilities, protective gear, and counselling. Work-related stress emerged from increased workload, staffing issues, and a lack of expertise. Concerns extended to family well-being and personal life. Enhancing the support infrastructure of faith-based health facilities in Ghana, including expanded psychological resources and the adoption of health emergency protocols would enable such facilities to secure health workers from mental distress during health emergencies.","23":"Mass gatherings increase infectious disease risks through human, environmental, and zoonotic pathways. The Grand Magal of Touba (GMT) involves the annual sacrifice of animals under limited biosafety, yet data on zoonotic pathogens are scarce. This cross-sectional exploratory study aimed to detect major zoonotic agents in livestock during the GMT and to provide baseline evidence to guide One Health surveillance. From 2022 to 2024, post-mortem samples (blood, nasal and rectal swabs, skin, ticks) were collected from sacrificed animals and analyzed using molecular and culture-based methods. 88 animals were included. <i>Borrelia<\/i> spp. was detected in 28.8\u00a0% of bovine blood samples, mostly in 2023 and 8.3\u00a0% of dromedaries. Enterohemorrhagic <i>Escherichia coli<\/i> occurred in 64.3\u00a0% of cattle and 33.3\u00a0% of dromedaries' rectal samples. Nasal swabs showed <i>Mycobacterium<\/i> spp in 54.9\u00a0% bovines and 75.0\u00a0% dromedaries. Among hard ticks from bovines (predominantly <i>Hyalomma<\/i> spp.), 10.2\u00a0% and 11.5\u00a0%) were infected with <i>Borrelia<\/i> spp. and <i>Rickettsia<\/i> spp., including <i>R. aeschlimannii<\/i> and <i>R. sibirica mongolitimonae<\/i>. and one case of <i>Coxiella burnetii<\/i> was found. In dromedaries, only <i>Borrelia<\/i> spp. (43.7\u00a0%) was found in ticks. No dermatophytes were isolated. These findings demonstrate active zoonotic circulation and stress the need for continuous surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in animals involved in the GMT. Given the close proximity of humans and livestock during such events, the potential for spillover of zoonotic agents necessitates a <i>One Health<\/i> approach, integrating veterinary, environmental, and human health surveillance. Future investigations should further characterize pathogen species to better inform risk reduction strategies.","24":"Biosecurity plays an important role in the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in the equine population. With competition organizers responsible for implementing and upholding biosecurity requirements at competitions, it is important to understand the biosecurity landscape at these locations where Ontario horses commonly travel and interact in large group settings. The objective of this study was to describe the perspectives, challenges and experiences of competition organizers of both sanctioned and unsanctioned events in Ontario, Canada regarding implementing equine biosecurity at competitions. This study used a qualitative content analysis in order to gather data describing the lived experiences of competition organizers. Of 53 invited participants, semi-structured, individual interviews were conducted virtually with 10 Ontario competition organizers in English disciplines (Eventing, Dressage, Hunter\/Jumper). A qualitative, inductive coding method was used to analyze the interview data. Interviews resulted in two major categories: (i) biosecurity at competitions is a balancing act among other important considerations and (ii) there is a disconnect between groups that play key roles in biosecurity at competitions. The recruitment process allowed for the possibility of introducing self-selection bias where some of the participants may have an existing interest in biosecurity, which may not be representative of all competition organizers. Individual interviews as well as the design of the interview guide helped to mitigate some potential for social desirability bias. Biosecurity at equestrian competitions is a multifaceted issue that requires stakeholder input and buy-in to be successful. However, there is an overall willingness from competition organizers to work toward finding a path forward to improving biosecurity and maintaining equine health and welfare at competitions.","25":"The transmission of respiratory pathogens is fundamentally shaped by human behaviors such as interpersonal contacts, use of face masks, and vaccination. Political party affiliation has been shown to be associated with health-related behaviors. Yet, partisan heterogeneity in health-related behaviors is typically not included in infectious disease transmission models. Here, we leveraged uniquely detailed data from the Berkeley Interpersonal Contacts Study (BICS) on partisan differences in contact rates, mask usage, and vaccination patterns during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find substantial differences in health-related behaviors by political affiliation. Republicans reported a significantly greater number of average daily contacts, lower propensity of using masks and of getting vaccinated for COVID-19. These findings hold even after controlling for observable demographic and location-based differences across survey respondents. We adapt the classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to incorporate partisan-specific behaviors and varying levels of political homophily to simulate an outbreak of a hypothetical respiratory pathogen. We find that the observed behavior differences lead to simulated Republicans experiencing higher infection and mortality rates and earlier peaks compared to Democrats. Incorporating greater within-group mixing further amplified partisan differences in disease outcomes. Finally, we show that failure to incorporate partisan behavioral heterogeneity in disease models can lead to inaccurate predictions about the size and timing of outbreaks in a population. The timing and size of infectious disease outbreaks are shaped by health-related behaviors that affect disease transmission. Using data specifically designed to measure interpersonal contacts and other health behaviors, we find that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Republicans reported a significantly greater number of average daily contacts, lower propensity of using masks and of getting vaccinated. These observed differences lead to Republicans experiencing higher infection and mortality rates and earlier peaks compared to Democrats in a model simulating a hypothetical respiratory infection. Incorporating a preference for within-group mixing further amplified partisan differences in disease outcomes. Failure to incorporate partisan behavioral heterogeneity in disease models can lead to inaccurate predictions about the size and timing of outbreaks in a population.","26":"The global surge in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) presents a significant public health threat, especially in developing nations like India with high infectious disease burdens and unregulated antibiotic use. Surveillance of bacterial pathogens and their resistance profiles is essential to inform empirical treatment and formulate antibiotic stewardship policies.\u00a0This study was conducted to evaluate the bacteriological profile and antimicrobial resistance patterns of clinical isolates over a 12-month period at a tertiary care hospital. The findings aim to guide empirical antibiotic therapy and strengthen hospital antibiotic stewardship policies through the development of a local antibiogram. A retrospective, observational study was conducted in the Microbiology Laboratory of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital in Nagpur, Maharashtra, India, from May 2024 to April 2025. Out of a total of 22,125 clinical specimens, 4603 (22.87%) were bacterial culture positive, and identification was done using standard conventional microbiological procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines M100 and M45 for <i>Salmonella typhi<\/i> and <i>Vibrio cholerae<\/i>. Data was analyzed. Of the total samples, 4603 (22.87%) yielded positive cultures. Gram-negative organisms predominated (80.42%). Among these, <i>Escherichia coli<\/i> (35.7%), <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae<\/i> (28.4%), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa<\/i> (21.1%), and <i>Acinetobacter<\/i> spp. (13%) were the most common pathogens. Of the 901 (19.6%) Gram-positive isolates, 73.7% were <i>Staphylococcus aureus<\/i>, of which 66.1% were methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus<\/i> (MRSA). <i>Enterococcus<\/i> comprised 152 (16.9%) isolates, and out of these, 4.6% isolates were vancomycin-resistant<i>\u00a0Enterococcus<\/i>\u00a0(VRE). High resistance rates were observed among Gram-negative organisms to third-generation cephalosporins (>70%) and fluoroquinolones (>40%). Among Gram-positive bacteria, resistance to penicillin was nearly universal (>95%), while linezolid resistance remained low (8.1%). The study reveals a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms in clinical samples, emphasizing the urgent need for routine surveillance, infection control measures, and rational antibiotic usage. Data generated from such studies can guide empirical therapy and help to develop regional antibiograms.","27":"There is little research on the subject, despite the rising prevalence of concurrent\u00a0<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<\/i>\u00a0(MTB) and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections. We present the case of a 48-year-old immunocompetent man diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis\u00a0with simultaneous sputum cultures positive for NTM. Chest imaging revealed bilateral upper-lobe cavitary lesions, and serial sputum studies demonstrated persistent MTB on acid-fast bacilli\u00a0smears and MTB polymerase chain reaction. Standard four-drug antituberculous therapy was initiated. However, concurrent sputum cultures subsequently grew\u00a0<i>Mycobacterium abscessus<\/i>\u00a0and later\u00a0<i>Mycobacterium avium<\/i>\u00a0complex, prompting the addition of amikacin, cefoxitin, and azithromycin based on infectious disease consultation. This case illustrates the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges inherent to MTB-NTM coinfection, where distinguishing true NTM disease from colonization is critical, and underscores the importance of multidisciplinary management.","28":"Group blood donation is a significant component of the urban blood supply. The imperative to enhance the management and utilization of this workforce, to increase the organizational mobilization capabilities of various blood donation entities, and to identify the pivotal factors influencing the successful mobilization of group blood donation efforts, thereby augmenting the total volume of group blood donations across the city, represents a critical research topic. This article adopts the organizational mobilization model of group blood donation as the entry point. A comprehensive investigation was conducted on the role of leadership prioritization within entities, the competencies of individuals responsible for managing group blood donations, the level of incentives provided to donating employees, and the engagement level of blood donors. This study retrospectively evaluates and ranks the importance of these four indicators across 100 blood donation entities in Beijing. The study revealed that the importance of leadership prioritization in blood donation (79%) emerged as the primary factor influencing successful group blood donation, followed by the level of incentives provided to blood-donating employees, the engagement level of blood donors, and the competence of the individuals responsible for organizing group blood donations. Among the four core factors influencing the mobilization of group blood donations, prioritization by entity leadership toward group blood donation activities is identified as the most crucial. The study also found that the broader social environment significantly impacts group blood donation. A favorable social environment facilitates group blood donation activities, whereas adverse conditions, such as severe infectious disease outbreaks or negative public perception toward voluntary blood donation, can detrimentally affect these activities.","29":"Community-based primary health care (CBPHC) has long underpinned health service delivery in resource-limited settings. However, demographic shifts, increasing chronic disease burdens, and digital transformations challenge its sustainability. This review synthesizes historical and contemporary evidence on CBPHC to assess effectiveness, identify limitations, and outline future directions toward universal health coverage (UHC). Using the Arksey and O'Malley framework, we conducted a scoping review of global literature from 1975 to 2025 across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey sources. Data were thematically analyzed into categories capturing evolution, achievements, challenges, and future directions. A total of 134 documents were reviewed. CBPHC improved access to essential services, particularly maternal and child health, infectious disease control, and health promotion. Programs led by community health workers and volunteers strengthened systems but faced persistent barriers such as attrition, limited funding, and weak integration. Case studies from Nepal, Ethiopia, Brazil, and Rwanda showed improved maternal and child outcomes and pandemic preparedness and resilience. Emerging challenges include syndemics, demographic shifts, and urbanization. CBPHC remains vital for advancing universal health coverage. Its sustainability depends on evolving into a diagonally integrated, people-centered, and digitally enabled model supported by equitable investment in governance, workforce training, and community engagement.","30":"mRNA vaccines, as a novel vaccine platform, have rapidly become a global research hotspot driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study employs a systematic analysis method based on clinical trial registries to conduct a descriptive statistical analysis of mRNA vaccine-related trials registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov database from March 2000 to July 2025. We compared characteristics such as the number of trials, geographical distribution, study type, funding sources, trial design, and indications, and used chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests for inter-group difference analysis. The results show that the number of mRNA vaccine clinical trials has experienced explosive growth after the pandemic, presenting obvious pandemic-driven characteristics and geographical differences. There are significant differences in registration characteristics and trial design among China, the United States, and Europe (<i>p<\/i><0.01). Indications have rapidly expanded from infectious diseases to multiple fields such as tumors, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic diseases, indicating that mRNA technology is transforming from an infectious disease prevention tool into a platform technology with broad therapeutic potential. From the perspective of clinical trial registration, this study provides empirical evidence for understanding the global research status, regional strategy differences, and future development directions of mRNA vaccines. It offers insights for vaccine development planning, international regulatory coordination, and global clinical trial strategic planning, assisting researchers, enterprises, and policymakers in making optimal decisions.","31":"To report on the investigation of a pseudo-outbreak of <i>Mycobacterium mucogenicum<\/i> and examine its clinical and operational impact. Outbreak investigation, retrospective cohort study. Academic medical center in Los Angeles, California. Patients whose bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures grew <i>M. mucogenicum<\/i> from 2020-2024. We performed an institutional outbreak investigation of <i>M. mucogenicum<\/i>, reviewed electronic medical records of a subset of affected patients (2023-2024), and assessed the operational impact. The incidence of <i>M. mucogenicum<\/i> in BAL cultures at Hospital A increased from 6.1% (29\/473) in 2020 to 18.6% (29\/156) in the first quarter of 2024. Epidemiologic investigation revealed non-sterile ice baths used to cool uncapped sterile syringes during bronchoscopy procedures as the contamination source. Next generation sequencing linked clinical isolates to <i>M. mucogenicum<\/i> recovered from a perioperative ice machine. Nearly all (157\/160) clinical isolates grew from nocardia media rather than acid-fast bacilli media. Among 154 patients, including 51 (33.1%) who were highly immunocompromised, no true infections were identified. Thirty-nine (25.3%) patients were referred to infectious diseases for consultation, seven (4.5%) underwent additional workup, and only one received targeted treatment. The pseudo-outbreak incurred 458 hours of microbiology technologist and infection preventionist time and cost the laboratory $88,426. A four-year pseudo-outbreak of <i>M. mucogenicum<\/i> traced to contaminated ice baths used during bronchoscopy resulted in unnecessary infectious disease referrals and substantial operational and financial burden to the institution. Avoidance of non-sterile ice use in procedures prevents costly and burdensome pseudo-outbreaks of environmental mycobacteria in healthcare settings.","32":"The convergence of nuclear and radiological preparedness with epidemic and pandemic response, reveals valuable opportunities for cross-disciplinary learning and capability development. Insights from the extensive career of Dr. C. Norman Coleman illustrate how methodologies from radiation medical countermeasures can inform strategies for managing emerging infectious diseases. While nuclear incidents are infrequent, infectious disease outbreaks occur regularly, underscoring the need for sustained, adaptable capabilities to detect and respond to such threats. To draw on some examples, case studies on the development and deployment of vaccines against filoviruses highlight measurable advances in response speed and efficacy, while persistent challenges related to equitable access to medical countermeasures during public health emergencies can be addressed drawing lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic. Iterative improvement, strategic planning and performance optimization is very important, as is, the value of understanding the structure of a problem to find its solution.","33":"In antimicrobial therapy, early intravenous-to-oral switch (IVOS) is recommended for eligible patients to minimize complications and optimize pharmacoeconomic outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a clinical pharmacist-led multimodal intervention strategy on IVOS rates. A prospective before-and-after study was conducted between January and June 2024, including observation and intervention periods. Hospitalized adults receiving IV antimicrobials were included. A two-round expert panel was convened prior to data collection to identify the criteria for IVOS. During the observation period, IV antimicrobial utilization patterns were monitored without intervention. The intervention period involved the implementation of a standardized IVOS protocol, targeted education for infectious disease physicians, and switch recommendations for eligible treatments. The primary endpoint was the difference in IVOS rates between study periods among eligible treatments. Among 962 IV antimicrobial courses evaluated, 213 (22.1%) met the eligibility criteria for IVOS. Among patients who met IVOS eligibility criteria, the proportion undergoing overall IVOS increased from 29.0% in the observation period to 54.0% in the intervention period (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Among 113 IVOS-eligible cases, pharmacists recommended switching in 57 (50.4%), with a 59.6% physician acceptance rate (34\/57). No significant differences were observed between periods for: microbiological cure rates, Clostridioides difficile infection incidence, intensive care unit admission rates, antimicrobial reinitiation within 48\u00a0h of treatment cessation, 15- and 30-day readmission and mortality rates. Antimicrobial costs decreased significantly from $15,600.30 (all-parenteral baseline) and $14,997.40 (adjusted baseline) to $8333.81 post intervention. The intervention was associated with a substantial increase in overall IVOS among eligible patients, supporting its effectiveness in promoting timely de-escalation from intravenous therapy. Clinical pharmacist-led initiatives optimize appropriate switching and antimicrobial utilization in stewardship.","34":"Although proper donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) is critical for infection prevention, detailed characterization of problems encountered during these processes in real-world settings during large-scale infectious disease outbreaks remains insufficient. This study aimed to analyze the characteristics and distribution of interception problems in the process of donning and doffing process in a large cabin hospital during the 2022 COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai. A prospective, real-world study was designed to collect and analyze data on irregularities observed during personal protective equipment (PPE) donning procedures in cabin hospital operations. The proportion of problems encountered during donning PPE was 5.29% (246\/4,652), while during doffing PPE, it was 8.44% (382\/4,525) (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The primary problem during donning PPE was related to problems with protective clothing, followed by problems with respirators. There was no significant difference in problem distribution among different posts (P\u2009=\u20090.459). The problems related to protective clothing mainly focused on loose fitting around the head and neck, making them prone to exposure during donning (56.25%, 99\/176) and contamination of the inner surface of protective clothing during doffing (46.43%, 91\/196). Respirator-related problems included failure of the seal test during donning PPE (61.54%, 24\/39) and shifting or loosening of the respirator during PPE doffing (73.68%, 14\/19). These findings identify critical gaps in PPE procedures and highlight the need for targeted training to address these issues, thereby reducing the risk of infection among healthcare personnel in mobile cabin hospitals.","35":"The outcome of periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) is not only contingent on treatment strategy and host factors, but also on the infecting organism. Corynebacterium, a genus of gram-positive bacterium, is uncommonly implicated in PJIs, but represents a challenge when present, as it commonly demonstrates resistance to often-used antibiotics. Given the limited data available, we sought to report on our institution's historical experience with managing PJI of the hip or knee due to Corynebacterium. A retrospective review was conducted of all total hip and knee arthroplasties performed at our institution from 2016 to 2023 for PJI in which the Corynebacterium genus was identified. Demographic, surgical, and clinical outcomes data were collected. Overall, 18 patients were identified who had a mean age of 65 years, and there was a predominance of women (94.4%). Patients, on average, had 4.9 prior surgeries. Surgical treatment of the Corynebacterium PJI included single-stage revision (n = five), irrigation and debridement (n = two), resection arthroplasty (n = one), and two-stage revision (n = 10). Overall, five cases (27.8%) were polymicrobial infections. Most cases received multiagent treatment (61.1%) administered in a concurrent (90.9%) fashion. The average antibiotic duration was 6.5 weeks. The majority (57.9%) of patients had a prior PJI, and all but one, for which data were unavailable, were infected with a multidrug-resistant strain of Corynebacterium. In total, 13 patients had tetracycline-resistant strains of Corynebacterium, and no cases demonstrated vancomycin resistance. At final follow-up (mean = 2.9 years, standard deviation = 2.8), 16 patients had never undergone amputation, 15 had no reinfection, and 12 patients were alive. Corynebacterium-associated PJIs represent a unique subset of disease that can be challenging to manage, in part due to its antibiotic resistance profile. However, with close collaboration between surgical and infectious disease teams, reasonable outcomes can be expected.","36":"To describe sociodemographic characteristics, facility use and health conditions among adult men residing in homeless shelters in Gda\u0144sk, Poland. Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of routinely collected non-governmental organization's operational records. From 551 male shelter residents supported by the Saint Brother Albert's Aid Society in 2023, a random sample of 226 was selected. We summarized age, disability status, hospitalizations, diagnoses (ICD-10) and shelter use with descriptive statistics. Median age was 60 years; 42% had certified disability. In 2023, 31% were hospitalized at least once and 17 individuals had \u22653 admissions. Frequent diagnoses included essential hypertension (20%), epilepsy (11-12%) and heart failure (10%); alcohol dependence was documented in 40%. Infectious burdens were present, including tuberculosis (\u223c6%). Facility use concentrated in shelters with care services; night-shelter users had more admissions\/removals and more fragmented stays. Adult men experiencing homelessness in Gda\u0144sk have substantial cardiovascular, neurological and infectious disease burdens with frequent hospital use. More studies based on medical registers and social services data should be conducted in the future.","37":"Salmonella Pullorum (S. Pullorum) incurs high mortality in chicks and disrupts intestinal health, and poses a severe threat to poultry industry and human health. However, in Chinese Taihe Black-Bone Silky Fowls (TBSF), the jejunum biomarker and molecular mechanism responding to S. Pullorum inoculation remain elusive. This study aims to characterize the jejunum proteome changes of TBSF affected by S. Pullorum. Using a data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics method, jejunum samples were collected from chicks and analyzed. These samples corresponded to the following treatment groups: the blank control group (TBSF with PBS treatment), and groups challenged with Salmonella Pullorum at doses of 1.39 \u00d7 10\u2078 CFU\/mL (L), 2.78 \u00d7 10\u2078 CFU\/mL (M), and 5.56 \u00d7 10\u2078 CFU\/mL (H). Meanwhile, the LD group (challenged with 1.39 \u00d7 10<sup>8<\/sup> CFU\/mL S. Pullorum and administered 0.1g\/kg bw 20% florfenicol powder) was used as experimental validation. A total of 8977 proteins were identified. Compared with the blank group, the numbers of differentially abundant proteins were 976 in the L group, 536 in the LD group, 635 in the M group, 673 in the H group, respectively. KEGG analysis showed that proteins affected by S. Pullorum were mainly associated with the signal transduction and infectious disease. EggNOG annotation of proteins showed that regulated proteins were significantly involved in intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport, as well as post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones. The results indicate that the alterations in jejunal protein profiles following S. Pullorum challenge are primarily driven by the host's active defense mechanisms against infection. Notably, the protein abundance of FABP6 and ACE2 was significantly higher in the Blank control group compared to all infected groups. This differential expression was further corroborated by RT-PCR analysis, which showed a corresponding increase in FABP6 mRNA levels in the Blank group, confirming FABP6 as a host gene responsive to S. Pullorum. Collectively, this study proposes potential protein biomarkers for the diagnosis of S. Pullorum infection, identifies promising targets for therapeutic development, and provides enhanced mechanistic insight into host-pathogen interactions. that changes of jejunum proteins in response to S. Pullorum are driven by the host's intensified efforts to counteract the infection. The protein abundance of FABP6 and ACE2 was significantly higher in the blank group than in the S. Pullorum-challenged groups. This observation was further validated at the transcriptional level, as RT-PCR analysis confirmed that FABP6 mRNA expression was also elevated in the blank group. These consistent results establish FABP6 as a host gene responsive to S. Pullorum infection. Consequently, this study not only identifies potential protein biomarkers for diagnosing S. Pullorum infection but also proposes novel targets for therapeutic development, thereby enhancing our understanding of the underlying host-pathogen interactions.","38":"Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has become an essential diagnostic and procedural adjunct in infectious disease practice, providing real-time bedside evaluation that improves patient outcomes. Despite its clinical relevance, broad implementation faces educational challenges, including limited access to hands-on training, inconsistent curricular integration, and lack of standardized certification pathways across all stages of medical education. This review frames POCUS education as a longitudinal, progressive pathway starting with foundational exposure in undergraduate medical curricula and advancing through competency-based postgraduate training, continuing professional development, and formal credentialing. Key educational frameworks such as G.O.O.S.E. and I-AIM structure the acquisition of both technical imaging skills and clinical integration, fostering critical ultrasound competence. Various stakeholders contribute to this continuum: medical schools form the foundational base; private sector programs fill training gaps using innovative educational approaches including immersive workshops, simulation, blended learning, and small-group pathology-focused sessions; and scientific societies provide leadership by defining standards, supporting collaborative research, and advocating for formalized training and certification. These innovative training modalities enable flexible, practical skill acquisition tailored to evolving clinical needs and diverse practice environments, accelerating learners' progression toward competent, autonomous ultrasound use. Such approaches are especially valuable in resource-limited settings or where traditional academic resources are constrained. Sustained multisectoral collaboration among academic institutions, private educators, scientific societies, and regulatory bodies is vital to ensure accessible, effective, and equitable POCUS training worldwide. By outlining this comprehensive educational roadmap and recognizing ongoing innovations, this review aims to guide the integration of POCUS into infectious disease care, ultimately improving global patient outcomes.","39":"Mass gatherings increase the risk of infectious disease transmission, particularly when healthcare systems are overstretched and underfunded. Wastewater and environmental surveillance (WES) offer a real-time, non-invasive method for monitoring pathogen circulation at the population level. During Uganda's 2025 Martyrs' Day pilgrimage, which drew over three million people, the Ministry of Health used WES to identify and respond to health threats. During the four days (May 31-June 3, 2025), 44 environmental samples were collected from 11 strategically selected sites, including wastewater manholes, septic tanks, stagnant surface water, and sacred water sources at both Catholic and Anglican shrines in Namugongo, Uganda. Samples were analyzed for multiple enteric and respiratory pathogens, including Mpox, using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Findings from this real-time surveillance directly triggered targeted, site-specific public health interventions during the mass gathering. All sacred water sources and National Water and Sewage Corporation (NWSC) stand posts remained pathogen-free, and some pilgrims were observed drinking from them. In contrast, wastewater and stagnant surface water harbored multiple pathogens, predominantly non-O1\/O139 Vibrio cholerae (36.4%) and Shigella spp. (31.8%), and Rotavirus A and Enterovirus (22.7% each). Notably, on Day 1, the detection of Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. in a stagnant pool two meters from the Catholic Sacred Martyrs' Lake prompted immediate drainage and chlorination. On the same day, the identification of multiple enteric pathogens in Anglican Septic Tank 2, located beneath a food-vending zone, prompted septic tank emptying, vendor relocation, and strict food safety enforcement. These findings also triggered rapid WASH upgrades, multilingual community risk communication, and deployment of on-site clinical screening posts. Pathogen diversity peaked on Day 4 (June 3, Martyrs' Day), with the first detections of SARS-CoV-2, Mpox virus, Rotavirus C, and RSV. This study demonstrates the first real-time use of WES to guide public health action during a major mass gathering in Sub-Saharan Africa. The detection of multiple pathogens, mapped by site and time, demonstrated the utility of WES as an early-warning indicator for mass gatherings. The site-specific data enabled rapid interventions, including Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) infrastructure upgrades, draining stagnant pools, relocating food vendors, and on-site clinical screening, which likely reduced outbreak risks. These results show how WES can strengthen surveillance and support proactive public health responses at mass gatherings. This first real-time WES deployment during a Sub-Saharan mass gathering demonstrates its value for early detection, rapid response, and multi-pathogen surveillance. The effective use of surveillance data to trigger coordinated, multi-agency interventions underscores WES as a vital component of mass-gathering preparedness within global health security frameworks.","40":"The rapid evolution of viral antigens poses a major challenge to infectious disease control, particularly for pathogens like influenza that undergo frequent antigenic changes. While deep mutational scanning and platforms such as Nextstrain have advanced our understanding of mutation effects and population-level viral dynamics, they often rely on strain-level analyses that may overlook key within-strain antigenic changes. In this study, we adopted a site-based approach to systematically identify and analyze hemagglutinin (HA) mutations in influenza viruses that differed from vaccine strains, using publicly available genomic data. We found that nonsynonymous mutations exhibiting vaccine-associated allele frequency changes were significantly enriched in epitope regions in both pH1N1 and H3N2, and that pH1N1 showed a higher proportion of rapid allele-replacement events occurring within a single influenza season, whereas H3N2 substitutions more often occurred across multiple seasons. Geographically, several mutations displayed allele frequency changes correlated with local vaccination coverage. Phylogenetic analyses further revealed that five nonsynonymous mutations in H3N2 arose independently across multiple clades. Serological assays confirmed reduced neutralization for multiple pH1N1 mutations, and computational protein stability analyses indicated that observed mutations tended to increase protein stability in both subtypes, and that in pH1N1, potential epitope mutations were more stabilizing than those in non-epitope regions. By integrating bioinformatics with experimental validation, our approach provides a refined understanding of how selective pressures shape antigenic evolution at the site level, which could aid future studies on vaccine effectiveness and epidemic trends.","41":"Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to healthcare globally and antimicrobial stewardship is fundamental in combating it. To analyse the agenda-setting process for the development of an antimicrobial restriction policy in Islamic Republic of Iran using Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework. We conducted key informant interviews with 21 experts who were involved in agenda-setting for an antimicrobial restriction policy in Islamic Republic of Iran and reviewed relevant documents relating to the development of the policy. We analysed the data using Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework. In 2019, Islamic Republic of Iran officially announced its antimicrobial restriction policy. Although national surveillance data were limited, multiple proxy indicators showed excessive use of antimicrobials and an increase in antimicrobial resistance in Islamic Republic of Iran. Based on available data, stakeholders made a compelling case for urgent policy actions to minimize irrational prescription and use of antimicrobials in the country. To balance antimicrobial stewardship with clinical needs, the antimicrobial restriction policy mandates infectious disease specialists to conduct laboratory and clinical assessment of patients, after taking the first antimicrobial dose, prior to treatment continuation. In addition to evidence, demonstrating the clinical, economic and public health benefits can help improve system responsiveness to antimicrobial stewardship policy and programme development.","42":"Climate change is increasingly linked to a surge of extreme weather events, raising the risk of disease outbreaks and food insecurity. Meanwhile, an increase in emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, many of which do not respond to available antibiotics owing to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), poses another great challenge to public health. Although some studies have shown that climate change and extreme weather events are associated with higher levels of AMR, much work remains to determine whether these are causal linkages or merely parallel reflections of an anthropogenic change. In this Review, we explore evidence on the relationship between climate and AMR, highlighting pathways through which rising temperatures and extreme weather events might intensify this pressing issue. Beyond existing ecological evidence demonstrating correlations between temperature and AMR prevalence in clinically important pathogens, a growing body of work suggests that the predominant impact of climate change on AMR manifests through an increase in infectious disease prevalence and a demand for antimicrobial use. Current evidence on the relationship between climate and AMR is insufficient in addressing issues related to temporality and causality, and underscores the need for further research to understand the nature of these complex relationships.","43":"People who are incarcerated experience disproportionately high rates of injecting drug use and infectious disease, including HIV, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis. However, comprehensive global data regarding the availability of services that prevent and manage infectious disease, injecting drug use and related harms remain limited and outdated. We provide the first systematic review to comprehensively examine the availability and coverage of infectious disease prevention, treatment, and harm reduction services for incarcerated populations globally. We conducted a systematic review of evidence for provision of opioid agonist treatment (OAT), needle syringe programs (NSPs), HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy (ART), hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment, tuberculosis screening and treatment, hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing, treatment, and vaccination in carceral settings. We searched from peer-reviewed and grey literature databases between 2000 and 2025 and used the most recent data available for each indicator. OAT was documented in 59\/207 countries (29 %), and NSPs in ten (5 %). HIV testing was documented in 86 countries (42 %) and ART in 79 countries (38 %). HCV testing was confirmed in 55 (27 %), with DAA treatment in 47 (23 %). HBV testing was identified in 51 countries (25 %), treatment in 36 (17 %), and vaccination in 41 (20 %). Tuberculosis screening was documented in 96 countries (46 %) and treatment in 81 (39 %). Fewer than 2 % (approximately 192,500) of the 11.3 million people incarcerated worldwide live in countries that offer OAT, NSPs, and treatment for HIV, HCV, HBV, and tuberculosis in at least one carceral facility. There is not a single country where incarcerated people have access to all such services in every facility. Programme level evidence was rarely available. The global shortage of services that prevent and treat infectious disease and harms related to injecting drug use in carceral settings is a critical public health issue and, compared with community standards, a breach of human rights. This study underscores the urgent need for international collaboration and policy reform to scale up and stabilise services that address the health needs of incarcerated populations, ultimately improving health outcomes for both incarcerated populations and wider community.

We describe a man in his early 30s presenting with progressive dyspnoea, fever and productive cough, initially treated as pneumonia. Despite multiple antibiotic courses, radiological lesions persisted. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry from transbronchial lung biopsy revealed extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. PET-CT confirmed localised pulmonary involvement, fulfilling criteria for PPL. The patient responded to rituximab-bendamustine chemoimmunotherapy with clinical improvement. This case highlights the importance of considering rare malignancies in non-resolving pulmonary consolidations.","45":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in neonates (MIS-N) is a rare condition linked to perinatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We report a case of a term male neonate presenting at birth with severe respiratory failure and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Initial evaluations, including chest X-ray and ECG, were unremarkable, but echocardiography showed elevated pulmonary pressures without structural abnormalities. Over the next few days, the infant developed diffuse skin peeling, acute kidney injury and hypertension, creating a perplexing clinical picture. Only after retrospective maternal history revealed a late-pregnancy febrile illness was SARS-CoV-2 testing performed: the mother was RT-PCR positive, and the neonate had markedly elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG with negative RT-PCR, consistent with proposed diagnostic criteria for MIS-N. The infant responded well to methylprednisolone (2\u2009mg\/kg\/day) and intravenous immunoglobulin (2\u2009g\/kg). Serial echocardiography revealed diffuse endomyocardial and coronary intimal echogenicity suggestive of calcification, reproducible across time and imaging platforms, a feature not previously described in MIS-N. Persistent systemic hypertension was attributed to MIS-N after exclusion of other causes. The infant was discharged on aspirin (3\u2009mg\/kg\/day) and antihypertensives and remains well on follow-up. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of MIS-N and highlights unusual sequelae such as myocardial calcification and neonatal hypertension.","46":"Bovine mastitis caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae is an infectious disease characterized by severe clinical manifestations, poor therapeutic outcomes, and substantial economic losses. Although type 1 fimbriae, with fimA as the major structural subunit, are a recognized virulence factor in Enterobacteriaceae, their specific role in bovine mastitis remains unclear. In this study, we constructed a \u0394fimA mutant from a clinical mastitis isolate to evaluate contributions of fimA to adhesion and virulence. Transmission electron microscopy revealed impaired fimbrial assembly in the mutant, whereas adhesion assays demonstrated significantly reduced binding to bovine mammary epithelial cells in vitro. At the bacterial level, transcriptome analysis revealed downregulation of type 1 fimbrial genes, iron acquisition systems, outer membrane protein, and several stress-related proteins, whereas type 3 fimbrial genes and lysozyme inhibitors were upregulated, suggesting compensatory regulation of adhesion and stress responses. In an in vivo murine intramammary infection model, \u0394fimA infection, compared with wild type (WT), resulted in significantly lower bacterial load, attenuated mammary inflammation, reduced histopathological damage, and decreased cytokine concentrations. Specifically, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were significantly reduced in \u0394fimA-infected tissues, Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage was significantly lower than in WT, and IL-1\u03b2 and NLRP3 had downward but nonsignificant trends. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR confirmed differential expression of representative immune-related genes, supporting a weaker proinflammatory response in the absence of fimA. Collectively, these findings implicated fimA as a key determinant of fimbrial assembly, epithelial adhesion and proinflammatory activation in the mammary gland, providing new mechanistic insights into relationships among fimbriae, colonization, and virulence in K. pneumoniae.","47":"Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, a global consensus arose on the need for a vaccine capable of protecting the human population from both known and unknown coronavirus threats. In April 2024, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) hosted a workshop to establish use cases for broadly protective coronavirus vaccines, using a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine candidate for prevention of SARS-CoV-X as an example. Workshop participants discussed implementation strategies and ideal product characteristics of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines that could be readily deployed within 100 days of SARS-CoV-X emergence. Here, we summarize the outputs from the workshop, which include the established use cases, as well as key considerations for research and development of pan-sarbecovirus vaccine candidates with characteristics to meet global needs. These use cases will be used to guide future investments and advance pandemic preparedness in line with CEPI's mission to develop safe, effective, globally accessible vaccines in as little as 100 days.","48":"AbstractHumans provide massive inputs of food to wildlife, with profound ecological and evolutionary consequences. By potentially altering wildlife host immunity, density, and behavior, provisioning can influence transmission of wildlife pathogens and thus may impose strong selection pressure on pathogens. But surprisingly we lack theory on the eco-evolutionary consequences of provisioning for host-pathogen dynamics. Here we develop a mathematical model of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a wildlife pathogen under provisioning, motivated by <i>Mycoplasma gallisepticum<\/i>, a bacterial pathogen that emerged, spread, and evolved higher virulence in provisioned house finches. We model how provisioning influences the evolution of pathogen virulence, defined here as the mortality increase associated with infection in identical background hosts. In our model, house finches recover from infection and acquire incomplete immunity; this incomplete immunity is stronger if their initial infection was with a more virulent pathogen strain (as previously found empirically). We find that even when provisioning improves individual host fitness (via survival, fecundity, or immune defenses), it should still select for higher pathogen virulence and thus may actually lead to declines in host populations. These negative effects arise because provisioning magnifies the impact of incomplete immunity, selecting for higher virulence and driving host populations down. Our results highlight that food provisioning can select for more virulent pathogens, with potentially far-reaching implications for conservation.","49":"Fungi exhibit remarkable morphological plasticity, which allows them to undergo reversible transitions between distinct cellular states in response to changes in their environment. This phenomenon, termed fungal morphogenesis, is critical for fungi to survive and colonize diverse ecological niches and establish infections in a variety of hosts. Despite significant advancements in the field with respect to understanding the gene regulatory networks that control these transitions, the metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we uncover a previously uncharacterized, conserved dependency between central carbon metabolism and de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids that is critical for fungal morphogenesis in two key fungal species. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that glycolytic flux is crucial to drive fungal morphogenesis in a cAMP-independent manner and perturbation of this pathway leads to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Remarkably, exogenous supplementation of sulfur-containing amino acids robustly rescues the morphogenesis defect induced by the perturbation of glycolysis in both <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae<\/i> and <i>Candida albicans<\/i>, underscoring the pivotal role of de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids as a downstream effector of morphogenesis. Furthermore, a <i>C. albicans<\/i> mutant lacking the glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase-1 (Pfk1), exhibited significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. Overall, our work elucidates a previously uncharacterized coupling between glycolysis and sulfur metabolism that is critical for driving fungal morphogenesis, contributing to our understanding of this conserved phenomenon.","50":"Seasonality plays a crucial role in the transmission dynamics of many infectious diseases, contributing to periodic fluctuations in disease incidence. The previously developed geographically dependent individual-level model (GD-ILM) has been effective in modeling infectious diseases, but does not incorporate seasonal effects, limiting its ability to capture seasonal trends. In this study, we extend the GD-ILM by introducing a seasonally varying transmission component, allowing the model to account for periodic fluctuations in infection risk. Our approach integrates a seasonally forced infection kernel to model periodic changes in transmission rates over time, leading to a novel spatiotemporal kernel. To facilitate efficient and reliable parameter estimation in this high-dimensional setting, we employ the Monte Carlo expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We apply our model to individual-level influenza A data from Manitoba, Canada, examining spatial and seasonal infection patterns to identify high-risk regions and periods, and thus informing targeted intervention strategies. The proposed model's performance is further validated through comprehensive simulation studies. Simulation results confirm that models omitting seasonal components lead to biased spatial parameter estimates under various disease prevalence conditions. To support reproducibility and practical application, we developed the SeasEpi R package publicly available on the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN), which implements the seasonal GD-ILM framework and provides tools for model fitting, simulation, and evaluation. The seasonal GD-ILM offers a more accurate framework for modeling infectious disease transmission by integrating both spatial and seasonal dynamics. It supports more accurate risk assessment and enhances public health responses by enabling timely and location-specific interventions based on seasonal transmission patterns.","51":"Influenza is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by the influenza virus, which has been circulating in humans for over a century. In contrast, COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2, emerged recently in December 2019. Following nearly four years of pandemic, the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 has transitioned towards an endemic state, suggesting a trend of long-term coexistence with humans. Concurrent or sequential coinfection with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 has been clinically observed to exacerbate pulmonary pathology and systemic inflammation in affected individuals. This review discusses the impact and elucidates the potential underlying mechanisms by which influenza and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection aggravates local lung injury and systemic host responses, aiming to inform improved prevention and clinical management strategies.","52":"Event-based surveillance (EBS) is a critical component of epidemic intelligence, supporting the timely detection of unusual public health events. However, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the status of EBS implementation across the WHO African region was not well documented. This study establishes a regional baseline of EBS modalities in place before the pandemic to inform future surveillance system evaluation and strengthening. We conducted a cross-sectional survey across all 47 WHO Member States in the African region between December 2019 and February 2020. A structured questionnaire was disseminated through WHO Country Offices to assess the presence, characteristics, and functionality of EBS modalities-including health facility-based EBS (HEBS), community-based surveillance (CBS), and media monitoring. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, while qualitative responses underwent thematic analysis. Thirty-seven countries (78.7%) responded, of which 84% (<i>n<\/i> =\u202f31) had implemented at least one form of EBS. HEBS was the most commonly reported modality (67.6%), followed by CBS (54.1%) and media monitoring (29.7%). Cholera, acute flaccid paralysis, measles, and meningitis were the most frequently detected conditions. While mobile phones were the primary channel for reporting, challenges included resource constraints and infrastructure gaps. Radio was the most widely used media source due to limited access to internet-based tools. Countries widely recognized EBS as a national priority but cited the need for sustainable financing, tools, and trained personnel. By early 2020, most countries in the region had adopted EBS, though implementation varied in scope and maturity. The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed expansion of many modalities, offering an opportunity to institutionalize gains. Strengthening EBS systems will require sustained investment, intersectoral coordination, and context-appropriate tools aligned with national capacities.","53":"Two-partner secretion system transporter proteins (TpsB) are widely conserved across Gram-negative pathogens. TpsB family proteins secrete exoprotein virulence factors that perform a myriad of functions such as adhesion and immune modulation. Despite their incredible importance in bacterial infectious disease, TpsB inhibitors have not yet been discovered. Here, we describe a potent inhibitor of FhaC, a TpsB protein produced by <i>Bordetella spp<\/i>. FhaC secretes the exoprotein FhaB that is essential for the establishment of whooping cough. We designed a peptide called P1 that we predicted would prevent substrate binding and lock FhaC in a secretion-inactive state. Simulations and biochemical assays supported our hypothesis and identified interactions important for P1 binding to FhaC. Strikingly, we observed that the peptide strongly inhibited FhaB secretion from clinical isolates and broadly reduced correlates of virulence. Together, this work provides a strong case for further development of a novel class of anti-TpsB anti-virulence compounds.","54":"Over the past 25 years, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a significant global health threat and a major cause of mortality. Foodborne diseases caused by drug-resistant bacteria capable of forming biofilms present serious health risks, necessitating innovative solutions for infectious disease management. Cellulose nanoparticles (CNPs), biocompatible and biodegradable, have found applications in targeted drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and tissue engineering. This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of curcumin-loaded cellulose nanoparticles (CLCN) and their effects on quorum sensing (QS) and biofilm formation in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive foodborne bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens<\/i>, <i>Chromobacterium violaceum<\/i>, and <i>Listeria monocytogenes<\/i>). FTIR confirmed molecular interactions between cellulose hydroxyl groups and curcumin. Thermal analysis (TGA\/DSC) demonstrated enhanced structural stability with a gradual mass loss profile. Further, elemental composition analysis showed presence of carbon (50.6%) and oxygen (49.4%) in CLCN. CLCN exhibited MICs of 2\u202fmg\/mL against all test strains except in <i>L. monocytogenes<\/i> (8\u202fmg\/mL). At highest tested sub-MIC, violacein pigment was inhibited by over 58% in <i>C. violaceum<\/i> 12,472. CLCN disrupted pyocyanin, pyoverdin, LasB elastase, and rhamnolipid production by 53, 44, 39, and 47%, respectively. Exoprotease activity in test pathogens decreased by up to 58%. Biofilm production in all pathogens was significantly inhibited in the range of 48-68% at 0.5xMICs. Also, CLCN effectively removed preformed biofilms up to 46%. This study demonstrates that CLCN disrupt QS-regulated virulence traits and destabilizing biofilm architecture. By targeting virulence rather than growth, CLCN minimize the likelihood of resistance development and may serve as an adjunct or alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy. Thus, CLCN offer a biocompatible and sustainable antimicrobial strategy for food packaging systems, that limits surface-associated contamination and enhance food safety.","55":"The current era of emerging infectious disease demands an elaboration of critical geography's approach to biosecurity. We argue for further engagement with historicizations of empire to tease out the racialized, colonial, and class structures that create biosecurity crises and solutions. We suggest that work in political economy and critical surveillance studies offers ways to untangle the processes of racial capitalism, extraction, and racial imprinting that create multi-scalar vulnerability in the first instance. By shifting analyses to those marginalized by dominant biosecurity mechanisms, we develop a critical biosecurity consciousness that provides a positive conception of justice.","56":"Infectious disease superspreading caused by heterogeneity in contact behavior has been observed to be an important determinant of epidemic dynamics and size in both empirical and theoretical settings. However, it has also been observed that the importance of this type of superspreading changes throughout an epidemic, generally in a decreasing manner as infections cascade from individuals with many contacts to those with fewer contacts. We provide an exact mathematical formulation of this phenomenon in strongly-immunizing (SIR) epidemics on static contact networks. Building on the edge-based modeling framework, we construct three metrics to track how superspreading changes through the course of an epidemic, respectively measuring infected nodes' contacts, exposures, and transmissions: (1) the mean degree of infected nodes, (2) the mean number of susceptible neighbors of infected nodes, and (3) the mean number of secondary cases that will be caused by newly infected nodes. We prove results about the behaviors of these metrics, highlighting the fact that their peak times all occur at less than half the time it takes for population-level infection prevalence to peak. This suggests that the importance of superspreading will be low when an epidemic is already near its peak, so contact-based control strategies are best employed as early in an outbreak as possible. We discuss implications for accurately measuring epidemiological parameters from incidence, mobility, contact tracing, and transmission data.","57":"Far ultraviolet-C (UVC) is an emerging, flexible technology for indoor air disinfection with the potential to reduce airborne transmission of pathogens while maintaining safety for human tissues. Despite its high efficacy to neutralize a wide range of pathogens and safety for human tissues, implementation of far UVC is hampered by regulatory gaps, consumer uncertainty, and unanswered research questions surrounding the formation and interaction of generated ozone and volatile oxidative byproducts. This commentary describes targeted recommendations for both epidemic-where rapid far-UVC deployment and ability to counter a wide variety of pathogens in balanced with potential environmental impacts on the indoor environment-and long term implementation scenarios, highlighting the need for human health risk studies, regulatory guidance for fa- UVC devices, and real-world cost benefit analyses, which consider the tradeoffs long term of far UVC and germicidal ultraviolet implementation. Far-UVC technologies demonstrate an exciting opportunity to promote the benefits of germicidal UV disinfection to more indoor spaces. More research is needed, however, to ensure its safe and equitable use and development. This work was in part informed by a workshop held by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, which convened experts from academia, government, and industry to evaluate the scientific and policy considerations for far UVC, comparing the new technology to traditional germicidal ultraviolet.","58":"Temperature responses of many biological traits-including population growth, survival, and development-are described by thermal performance curves (TPCs) with phenomenological models like the Briere function or mechanistic models related to chemical kinetics. Existing TPC models are either simple but inflexible in shape or flexible yet difficult to interpret in biological terms. Here we present flexTPC, a model that is parameterized exclusively in terms of biologically interpretable quantities: the thermal minimum, optimum, and maximum, the peak trait value, and thermal breadth. FlexTPC can describe unimodal temperature responses of any skewness and thermal breadth, enabling direct comparisons across populations, traits, or taxa with a single model. We apply flexTPC to various microbial and entomological datasets, compare results with the widely used Briere model, and find that flexTPC often has better predictive performance. The interpretability of flexTPC makes it ideal for modeling how thermal responses change with ecological stressors or evolve over time.","59":"No abstract available","60":"Tuberculosis is a major infectious disease with high global mortality, and its first-line drugs, rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INZ), are associated with serious adverse effects and public health risks when improperly administered, due to toxicity, environmental residues, and the potential induction of mycobacterial resistance. Low-cost, rapid analytical methods with simple instrumentation, particularly electrochemical approaches using screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE), are highly desirable for detecting these drugs. In this work, a novel electrochemical method for the simultaneous quantification of RIF and INZ was developed employing linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) as the analytical technique. As an electrochemical platform, a miniaturized and portable carbon-integrated substrate system was modified via drop-casting using a nanocomposite based on carbon black (CB) with cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2<\/sub>), which was comprehensively characterized using structural, morphological, and electrochemical analyses. Importantly, this CB\/CeO<sub>2<\/sub> material offered a drastic synergic effect for improving the electrochemical response of both antibiotics. The voltammetric strategy provided wide linear ranges for INZ (3.66 to 343.0\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L<sup>-1<\/sup>) and RIF (0.611 to 57.3\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L<sup>-1<\/sup>) with limits of detection of 0.638\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L<sup>-1<\/sup> and 0.0390\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L<sup>-1<\/sup>, respectively. In addition, the sensor exhibited excellent fabrication reproducibility with RSD <4.76 %, as well as high selectivity for the analyte, making SPCE\/CB\/CeO<sub>2<\/sub> applicable to tap water, human urine, and synthetic human serum, with satisfactory recoveries ranging from 96.9 to 106 % demonstrating its potential for monitoring aquatic and biological matrices.","61":"Infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, is endemic to the Americas and can irreparably damage the cardiac and gastrointestinal systems during decades of parasite persistence. Diagnosis of chronic infection requires confirmation by multiple serological assays due to the imperfect performance of existing tests. Current serology tests were developed using small specimen sets predominantly from South America, and lower performance has been observed in patients who acquired infection in Central America and Mexico. To improve Chagas disease serology, we evaluated antibody responses against the entire T. cruzi proteome with phage display immunoprecipitation sequencing and further evaluated high prevalence antigens by immunoassay. We utilized specimen sets representing Mexico, Central America and South America and varying cardiac disease presentations, from 185 cases and 143 controls. We identified over 1,300 antigenic T. cruzi peptides. A trans-sialidase antigen demonstrated high seroprevalence across all regions and has not previously been described as a diagnostic target. Orthogonal validation of this peptide demonstrated increased antibody reactivity for infections originating from Central America. This study provides proteome-wide identification of seroreactive T. cruzi peptides across a range of endemic populations not previously represented in antigen discovery and identifies a trans-sialidase peptide antigen (TS23) with potential for translation into diagnostic serological assays. Not Applicable.","62":"Transition metals, such as iron and zinc, are indispensable trace elements for eukaryotic life, acting as co-factors in essential processes ranging from metabolism to DNA replication. These metals can be transported into cells by an evolutionary-conserved family of metal transporters; however, how the ubiquitous mammalian parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii<\/i> acquires essential metals has been unknown. Here, we have identified and characterised the first iron and zinc importer in <i>T. gondii<\/i>. This transporter, named ZFT, localised to the parasite plasma membrane and is essential for the parasite's life cycle. We find ZFT is regulated by iron availability and overexpression sensitises cells to excess iron and zinc. Using a conditional knockdown system, we find that knockdown of ZFT leads to reduction in mitochondrial respiration and a switch to a more quiescent lifecycle stage. To confirm transport activity, we find that knockdown of ZFT leads to a reduction in parasite-associated zinc and iron, and ZFT expression complements loss of zinc transporter activity in a yeast model. Further, expression of ZFT in <i>Xenopus<\/i> oocytes demonstrates direct uptake of iron, which is outcompeted in the presence of zinc. Overall, we have identified the first metal uptake transporter in <i>T. gondii<\/i> and demonstrated the importance of iron and zinc to the parasite. This finding advances our understanding of how this obligate intracellular parasite acquires nutrients from its host.","63":"This report presents a case of a young female with Sj\u00f6gren's disease who developed a non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) abscess in the right parotid gland. Following an unsuccessful four-month course of antibiotic therapy, she underwent a superficial parotidectomy. This was an unusual case in this demographic, considering that most cervical NTM infections are diagnosed in pediatric patients who have a characteristic violaceous neck mass. Her case was reviewed using the medical record, and photo-documentation was conducted throughout follow-up visits in the outpatient clinic. Infectious disease specialists were heavily involved in determining her antibiotic treatment plan, which spanned over four months. The initial therapy was complicated by multiple antibiotic changes and pauses in treatment due to adverse effects, including chest tightness and elevation of liver function tests (LFTs). After completion of antibiotic therapy, the patient continued to experience episodes of parotitis without abscess, and she ultimately underwent a right superficial parotidectomy. No evidence of recurrence was observed during postoperative follow-up. This case report illustrates a rare cause of NTM infection in an immunocompetent adult patient and provides important management guidance for providers who may encounter similar patients.","64":"The obligate intracellular parasite, Leishmania, causes leishmaniasis as an infectious disease. The parasite is transmitted through female sandfly bites and infects the host mononuclear phagocytes, leading to severe skin lesions and fatal systemic infection. The quick diagnosis and effective treatment can prevent the development scars and chronic or uncontrollable disease forms. The current chemical and physical treatments have limitations; hence, the use of plant compounds and their derivatives is a new proposed treatment method. Therefore, in this review, the recent advances in combination therapy of cutaneous leishmaniasis were investigated. The information was obtained from all articles published in PubMed, SciELO, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases (1998-2022). Search terms used were \"Combination Therapy\" AND \"Cutaneous Leishmaniasis.\" The data showed increased synergistic efficacy or shortening the course of treatment and few adverse effects in the combined treatment of (CL), <i>in vitro<\/i> and <i>in vivo<\/i>. Expanding the combination therapy in clinical trials could open a new insight in treatment strategies of CL.","65":"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have transformed genome editing through unprecedented precision, and next-generation variants (base and prime editors) further enhance specificity by enabling targeted nucleotide changes without introducing double-strand DNA breaks. These technologies have unlocked broad applications in therapeutic gene correction, functional genomics, infectious disease management, diagnostics, agricultural engineering, environmental biotechnology, and synthetic biology. However, the targeted delivery of these systems remains a major challenge due to the large and chemically distinct nature of their components, including Cas protein or its base\/prime editor fusions, guide RNA, and in some cases, DNA repair templates-which complicate packaging, stability, and cellular uptake. Additional hurdles arise from tissue and cell-type specificity, differential intracellular environments, variable editing efficiencies, and the persistent risk of off-target genome modifications. This review outlines the key challenges in the delivery of CRISPR technologies as well provides a comprehensive overview of both current and emerging delivery strategies, including viral vectors (adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, and lentivirus), non-viral physical approaches (microinjection, electroporation, ultrasound, and hydrodynamic tail-vein injection), and nanoparticle-based modalities (lipid and polymeric nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, DNA nanostructures, and extracellular vesicles). We also discussed the diverse applications of CRISPR-Cas9 in gene therapy, immune cell engineering for cancer therapies, and agricultural innovation.","66":"The United States has long played a central role in global health through its engagement with the World Health Organization (WHO) and through major bilateral programs, including the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). These investments have contributed to health infrastructure development, disease surveillance, and the expansion of treatment and prevention programs across Africa. The recent U.S. withdrawal from WHO and the freezing of USAID funding raise concerns for infectious disease control, healthcare delivery, and global health security, particularly in settings with high dependence on external financing. This commentary argues that the U.S. withdrawal, while disruptive, should not be understood solely as a setback, but as an opportunity for African governments to assume greater ownership of their health systems and exercise leadership through deliberate political and policy choices. These include increased domestic health financing, stronger institutional governance, and enhanced regional coordination. The paper outlines pathways for sustaining donor-built infrastructure, expanding local pharmaceutical and diagnostic manufacturing, and aligning public\u2013private partnerships with national health priorities. By strengthening domestic capacity and regional cooperation, African governments can reduce vulnerability to external funding shocks, improve outbreak preparedness, and play a more active role in shaping global health security agendas.","67":"Fever is the leading reason for consultation among children in general practice. 20% of febrile children require additional tests to distinguish between viral infections and severe bacterial infections. Point of care capillary C-reactive protein (POC CRP) testing provides on-site results within 5\u2009min but remains underutilised in primary care settings in France. This study will demonstrate how the use of POC CRP could optimise the care pathway for febrile children, saving time for physicians and patients, and making economic savings. This is a multicentre, prospective, cluster-randomised stepped-wedge trial that will take place from September 2025 to March 2026. The required sample size is estimated at 420 patients. The primary outcome is the difference in referral rates to facilities equipped for emergency laboratory testing (medical biology laboratories, emergency departments) when using POC CRP versus standard care. The study will be conducted in primary care practices and out-of-hours clinics in south France among febrile children aged 3 months to 15 years, over the 6-month viral and bacterial epidemic period. A cost-consequence analysis and a budget impact assessment will also be performed. The protocol was approved by the Ile de France VII Committee for the Protection of Persons (2024-A02844-43), the French Advisory Board on Medical Research Data Processing and the French Personal Data Protection Authority. The study was prospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov. NCT06910631.","68":"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a globally concerning infectious disease, and significant challenges persist in attaining the 2030 targets set by the WHO. With the rapid advancements in computer-aided detection (CAD) technology, CAD-assisted Chest X-Ray (CAD-CXR) has been applied in TB patients triaging, but the practical application value of the CAD-CXR system in real-world primary healthcare settings in China for TB prevention and control has not been fully elucidated. This protocol reports a design of a cluster randomised controlled trial (CRCT), which aims to evaluate the effectiveness and clinical pathway of CAD-CXR in enhancing TB diagnostic yield in primary healthcare settings, thereby contributing to global TB elimination strategies. Scheduled for September 2025, this CRCT will recruit 22 townships in Yichang of Hubei Province, China. These townships will be randomly allocated at a 1:1 ratio to either the CAD-CXR system intervention group or the control group. In the intervention group, healthcare providers will use the CAD-CXR analysis system to assist in TB screening, whereas the control group will rely solely on conventional CXR interpretation by radiologists. The primary outcome of the study is the TB diagnostic yield; the secondary outcomes include diagnostic delay duration and the accuracy of the CAD-CXR system. These metrics will be comprehensively evaluated to assess the effectiveness of the CAD-CXR intervention. Findings from this study are anticipated to offer evidence-based recommendations regarding the optimal application scenarios and implementation pathways for CAD-CXR. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Peking Union Medical College (CAMS&PUMC-IEC-2025-044). Findings of this study will be disseminated through traditional academic pathways, including peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. NCT06963606.","69":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease with high mortality and limited therapeutic options. Poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation and innate immune modulation. Although PCBP2 has been reported to negatively regulate antiviral signaling in other viral infections, its role in Dabie bandavirus (DBV) infection remains unclear. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was performed to characterize PCBP2 mRNA expression across immune cell populations in peripheral blood. PCBP2 expression levels were further examined in DBV-infected clinical samples, IFNAR\u207b\/\u207b mouse models, and THP-1 cells using quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. THP-1 cells with plasmid-mediated PCBP2 overexpression or lentivirus-mediated PCBP2 knockdown were established to investigate the functional role of PCBP2. Activation of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway was evaluated by assessing key signaling molecules and downstream interferon responses. The impact of PCBP2 on DBV replication was determined by TCID<sub>50<\/sub> assay, viral nucleoprotein (NP) expression, and immunofluorescence analysis. PCBP2 expression was significantly downregulated during DBV infection in clinical samples, animal models, and cell cultures, and reduced PCBP2 expression was associated with increased disease severity and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Functional analyses demonstrated that PCBP2 suppressed DBV-induced activation of type I interferon signaling and interferon-stimulated genes, including ISG12a and G1P3. Mechanistically, PCBP2 directly interacted with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein MAVS and promoted its K48-linked polyubiquitination, resulting in proteasome-dependent degradation and attenuation of the MAVS-TBK1-IRF3 signaling axis. Consistent with its immunosuppressive role, PCBP2 knockdown significantly reduced DBV replication, whereas PCBP2 overexpression enhanced viral replication in THP-1 cells. These findings identify PCBP2 as a critical negative regulator of RLR-mediated antiviral signaling during DBV infection. By facilitating MAVS degradation and suppressing innate immune responses, PCBP2 promotes viral replication, providing new insights into DBV immune evasion mechanisms and highlighting PCBP2 as a potential host-directed therapeutic target for SFTS.","70":"No abstract available","71":"Tuberculosis (TB) remains the world's deadliest infectious disease, with treatment increasingly complicated by the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains (MDR-TB). This study conducted structure-based drug screening targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein kinase B (MtPknB), a serine\/threonine kinase essential for M. tuberculosis survival and proliferation, to identify novel anti-TB drug candidates. From the ChemBridge library, a hierarchical screening pipeline integrating docking and molecular dynamics simulations identified candidate compounds. Among these, a quinoline-pyridine hybrid chemical demonstrated antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis (IC<sub>50<\/sub>\u00a0=\u00a031.8\u00a0\u03bcM) without toxicity to Escherichia coli or mammalian cells. MM-PBSA and ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) analyses revealed LEU17, VAL25, and MET155 as key stabilizing residues in the MtPknB active site. ProLIF interaction fingerprinting confirmed stable hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions formed by the quinoline-pyridine hybrid chemical. SwissADME and ProTox-3.0 predictions indicated favorable drug-like properties for the quinoline-pyridine hybrid chemical, despite potential toxicity risks. Structure-activity relationship analysis of the quinoline-pyridine hybrid chemical analogs demonstrated that subtle variations in hydrophobic interactions and substituent positioning significantly influence antibacterial potency. These findings position these chemicals as promising lead compounds for MtPknB-targeted anti-TB drug development.","72":"African swine fever (ASF) continues to threaten pig production systems across Southeast Asia, yet regional epidemiological patterns remain fragmented. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized prevalence data to provide a consolidated assessment of ASF burden, spatial distribution, and temporal trends from 2019 to 2023. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across eight major databases and supplementary sources, with protocol registration in the Open Science Framework. Four reviewers independently screened studies, and eligible publications underwent quality appraisal using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. Data extraction encompassed prevalence estimates, diagnostic methods, sample types, and geographic information, which were subsequently mapped using QGIS. Meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, meta-regression modelling, and Egger's test were performed in R Studio using the \"meta\" and \"metafor\" packages. Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, representing seven Southeast Asian countries. The random-effects model yielded an overall pooled prevalence of 29.14% (95% CI: 20.56-37.72), with substantial heterogeneity (I<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0=\u00a0100%; \u03c4<sup>2<\/sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.1012). Subgroup analyses demonstrated marked variations by study period, diagnostic method, sample type, and country, with the highest prevalence estimates reported in Vietnam and Lao PDR. Meta-regression identified a significant decline in prevalence over time (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Spatial mapping revealed pronounced regional burden prevalence, particularly in the Lao PDR and southern Vietnam. Funnel plot asymmetry and regression testing suggested the presence of small-study effects. These findings underscore the persistent and heterogenous nature of ASF across Southeast Asia, emphasizing the need for harmonized surveillance, strengthened biosecurity in smallholder systems, and enhanced diagnostic capacity.","73":"As the most prevalent form of genetic variation, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are strongly associated with disease pathogenesis, microbial resistance, and pathogenicity. The rapid mutation rates of viruses such as influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 highlight the urgent need for multifunctional diagnostic tools capable of effectively distinguishing emerging variants. However, current clinical SNPs detection methods often require complex primer\/probe designs and sophisticated instruments, which limits their wide application in resource-constrained settings. Here, we developed the LIVE-SNP method, a rapid ligation-mediated isothermal assay for the visual evaluation of SNPs with high sensitivity and specificity. This method employs multicolor fluorescent probes to establish multiplex assays for the simultaneous identification of different SNPs, allowing for direct discrimination of target types through visual observation of fluorescent signals. The established method exhibits high specificity in identifying SNPs in both RNA and DNA. It can accurately detect drug-resistant single-nucleotide mutations in influenza A virus and efficiently identify antimicrobial resistance mutations in bacteria. Furthermore, we have developed a compact hand-held device integrating heating and fluorescence detection modules, which facilitates rapid on-site detection of pathogenic microorganisms and their variants, providing a powerful technical platform for applications in food safety, genotyping, and infectious disease control.","74":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a serious infectious disease that has received widespread attention. This study focused on the predictive value and trends of cytokines in SFTS patients. Information on 128 patients with SFTS was retrospectively collected from January 2019 to January 2023 at a large general hospital in Anhui Province, China. Of these, 34 died during the course of the disease. Compared to survivors, non-survivors exhibited significantly elevated cytokine levels and lower CD4\u207a\/CD8\u207a T-cell counts. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that TNF-\u03b1 (adjusted HR\u2009=\u200913.602, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.197-154.539) was an independent predictor of death with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.901. TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-8 levels were found to be correlated with viral titers. Longitudinal monitoring revealed distinct cytokine dynamics during the disease course. Combining high-dose intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) with ribavirin effectively reduced the levels of IL-6, IL-2R, and IL-10, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for clinical practice.","75":"Syphilis is a systemic infectious disease that can involve both ocular tissues and the central nervous system,\u00a0with syphilitic uveitis representing one of its ocular manifestations.\u00a0We report a rare case of syphilitic uveitis occurring in conjunction with chiasmal optic neuritis. A 48-year-old man presented with blurred vision in the right eye and was found to have bilateral acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis with vitreous opacity in the left eye. Visual field testing demonstrated bitemporal hemianopia-like defects, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed enhancement of the optic chiasm. Serologic testing confirmed syphilis. Oral amoxicillin therapy resulted in complete resolution of the inflammation and recovery of vision. This case highlights that bitemporal hemianopia in patients with syphilitic uveitis may reflect concurrent chiasmal involvement rather than uveitic pathology alone, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial for achieving favorable visual outcomes.","76":"Based on the considerations of round-trip in the treatment process, this paper presents a mathematical model aimed at studying the dynamic behaviour and epidemiological trends of HIV\/AIDS.

Subsequently, using cumulative HIV\/AIDS case data reported in China, we estimate model parameters using the least squares method, achieving a good fit. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were performed on the model parameters to explain the dependence of the parameters on the infection variables. Finally, the model is applied to evaluate the control effects of treatment coverage at different stages of infection. The results suggest that reducing HIV\/AIDS exposure, improving HIV\/AIDS screening, promoting infectious disease treatment and increasing disease prevention awareness are the most effective measures to prevent HIV\/AIDS infection.","77":"Periodontitis is a chronic, multifactorial infectious disease affecting the oral cavity, destroying the periodontal supporting tissues, including alveolar bone resorption and loss of clinical attachment. These changes can result in the formation of intrabony defects and if left untreated, it can ultimately result in tooth loss. To enhance periodontal regeneration, several pharmacologic agents-alendronate (ALN), rosuvastatin (RSV), atorvastatin (ATV), metformin (MF), and melatonin (ML)-have demonstrated promising osteoanabolic and anti-inflammatory effects. When combined with platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), these agents may further enhance clinical and radiographic outcomes. This study aimed to assess the adjunctive benefits of various drug-PRF combinations on clinical attachment level (CAL) gain and bone fill (BF) in chronic periodontitis patients. This network meta-analysis (NMA) adhered to PRISMA-NMA standards and was recorded in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42024600432). An extensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed\/ Medline, Wiley Online Library, Embase, and CENTRAL databases identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published after 2016. The analysis included ten studies comprising RCTs with 393 participants containing intrabony or furcation region defects and follow-up periods of 6 and 9\u00a0months. PRF with MF demonstrated the highest efficacy for CAL gain (SUCRA 1.00), followed by PRF with ALN (0.60) and RSV (0.70). For bone fill, PRF with ALN ranked highest (SUCRA 0.90), followed by RSV (0.90) and MF (0.60). ML and ATV combinations showed modest effects, while PRF alone and placebo consistently ranked lowest (SUCRA\u2009\u2264\u20090.20). PRF combined with MF, ALN, and RSV appears to be the most effective therapeutic option for managing bony defects in chronic periodontitis. Future studies should confirm these findings through additional large and long-term clinical trials. The study provides clinically relevant evidence supporting the adjunctive use of pharmacologic agents with PRF to optimize regenerative outcomes. Such combinations can improve bone fill and attachment gain, offering predictable benefits for patients with chronic periodontitis.","78":"The COVID-19 pandemic prompted widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like lockdowns and masking in Poland (2020\u20132022), significantly altering pathogen circulation. This created a unique opportunity to study the extended effects of these measures on other communicable diseases, moving beyond short-term observations. This study aimed to assess how the pandemic and associated NPIs affected the incidence of 17 notifiable infectious diseases in Poland over an extended period, from January 2014 to December 2022. Using national surveillance data aggregated monthly, we compared incidence during pandemic years (2020\u20132022) against pre-pandemic (2014\u20132018) and baseline (2019) periods. Data were deseasonalized. A negative binomial generalized linear model calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) relative to 2019, controlling for confounders. Spearman correlation measured associations between disease incidence, COVID-19 cases, and nine NPIs. From 2020 to 2022, 13 of 17 diseases showed cumulative declines compared to 2014\u20132019, including whooping cough (peak reduction IRR 0.11 in 2021 vs. 2019), scarlet fever, chickenpox, and mumps. Invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae decreased initially but rebounded in 2022. Conversely, Clostridioides difficile incidence increased significantly (2021 IRR 1.84 vs. 2019). Norovirus, HIV, and syphilis surged later, coinciding with NPI relaxation. Higher NPI stringency generally correlated negatively with respiratory pathogens. Long-term observation confirmed that widespread NPIs suppressed many communicable diseases, particularly respiratory infections, beyond SARS-CoV-2. The rebound of several infections upon NPI relaxation suggests potential shifts in population susceptibility. These findings can inform future public health strategies balancing disease control and societal needs, though further research on long-term dynamics is warranted. Not applicable.","79":"Limited data informing evidence-based regimens for antibiotic use in neonates undergoing fetal myelomeningocele (fMMC) repair have been published to date, and no standard of care has been established across centers. The goal of this study was to describe current neonatal antibiotic use practices following fMMC repair within the Children's Hospitals Neonatal Consortium (CHNC), a collaborative network of North American institutions with Level IV neonatal intensive care units. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of site sponsors at all 48 CHNC centers from April 2024 to January 2025, and invited CHNC Fetal Therapy Focus Group members in May 2024, with one response requested per center. A neonatologist at 34 centers (center response rate = 71%) completed the survey, of which 30 (88%) reported performing fMMC repair surgery (15\/34, 44%) or delivering\/receiving fMMC neonates (15\/34, 44%) at their center. One-quarter of responding centers (7\/30, 23%) reported having an existing clinical protocol for antibiotic management for fMMC neonates after birth. Notably, there was heterogeneity across existing protocols with respect to criteria for antibiotic use, the specific antibiotics used, and the duration of use. Responding centers reported administering antibiotics with guidance from infectious disease, neurosurgery, and fetal specialists. Two responding centers (6%) reported performing beta-2 transferrin testing on dehisced wounds when there is a suspected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, while the majority did not do so (20\/30, 67%), and the remainder did not know their institutional practice (7\/30, 23%). Current antibiotic use in fMMC neonates after birth varies widely between centers in North America, highlighting the need for evidence-based data to inform the development of best practice guidelines.","80":"Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)\/atypical mycobacteria are opportunistic pathogens ubiquitous in the environment. Recently, NTM cases causing skin and soft tissue infections are on the rise, owing to the improved diagnostic techniques as well as heightened number of procedures. A man in the mid 60s with diabetes, on insulin for the past 20 years, presented with multiple painful swellings, a few of them with pus discharge, over the insulin injection sites of arms, abdomen and thighs for the past 10 months. Local ultrasonography revealed anechoic collections surrounding increased vascularity in the subcutaneous planes. Histopathology showed suppurative inflammation with a large area of necrosis in the lower dermis and subcutaneous fat. Acid-fast bacilli culture grew NTM and was identified as <i>Mycobacterium lentiflavum<\/i> by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region. The lesions dramatically improved with clarithromycin and ofloxacin, which were continued for a total of 5 months.","81":"Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major cause of infectious disease globally, with young children serving as key reservoirs for transmission. This study evaluated pneumococcal carriage and serotype distribution among young children in Portugal, six months after the lifting of COVID-19 public health measures and seven years after the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) into the National Immunization Plan. A cross-sectional study was conducted in late 2022 among children aged 18\u00a0months to 6\u00a0years attending day-care centers in an urban region. Saliva samples, vaccination records, and demographic\/clinical data were collected. Pneumococcal carriage was determined by qPCR targeting lytA and piaB genes. Molecular serotyping of 65 serotypes\/serogroups was performed. New primers\/probes were designed and validated for serotypes\/serogroups 5, 7A\/F, 9A\/V, 9N\/L, 17F and 33A\/F\/37, expanding the range of serotypes that could be reliably identified. Among 584 children, 34.9% were pneumococcal carriers. Carriage of PCV13 serotypes was low, except for serotypes 3 (7.8%) and 19F (5.4%). Among non-PCV13 serotypes, 23A (10.8%), 15B\/C (10.3%), 23B (9.8%), and 11A\/D (9.3%) were the most frequent. Theoretical coverage of PCV13, PCV15, and PCV20 was 17.6%, 23.0%, and 46.1%, respectively. Children 4-6\u00a0years were nearly 15 times more likely to carry PCV13 serotypes than those aged 18-24\u00a0months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012). Six months post-COVID-19 restrictions lifting, serotype distribution largely resembled the pre-pandemic period. Although saliva sampling had lower sensitivity than nasopharyngeal swabbing for estimating overall pneumococcal carriage prevalence, it was particularly useful to assess serotype distribution. Importantly, in a context where nasopharyngeal swabbing was met with reluctance, saliva sampling emerged as a practical, effective, and non-invasive alternative for pneumococcal serotype carriage surveillance.","82":"The convergence of emerging infectious diseases, accelerating ecological changes, and increasing global mobility makes Vaccine Literacy (VL) a critical component of contemporary travel medicine. Enhanced VL can facilitate more effective provider-traveler communication, ultimately reducing infectious disease transmission risks associated with international travel. This cross-sectional survey aimed to measure VL levels among Italian travelers through an online survey using the 'Vaccine Literacy Brief Tool' (VLBT), a new three-item instrument assessing functional, interactive, and critical dimensions, derived from previously validated measures. Additional study objectives were to explore VL relationships with antecedents, attitudes, and outcomes, as well as to establish the tool's construct and criterion validity within the traveler population. Enrollment was conducted through a QR code displayed at nine vaccination clinics across five Italian regions, linking to an anonymous questionnaire (Google Forms) that visiting travelers could voluntarily access and complete before receiving vaccination for their trip. In addition to VL skills, the psychological antecedents of Vaccine Hesitancy (VH), the \"3Cs\" (confidence, complacency, convenience) were assessed. Additional measures included demographic and travel-related variables, as well as behavioral, cognitive and intentional vaccination outcomes. A total of 534 questionnaires were collected between January and July 2025. Participants showed a mean VL score of 3.07 \u00b1 0.66 on a four-point Likert scale, significantly lower than the 3.21 \u00b1 0.42 reported in previous general population studies (<i>p<\/i> < .001). The mean 3Cs score was 1.92 \u00b1 0.60, indicating relatively high VH levels. VL and 3Cs scores showed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.204, <i>P<\/i> < .001). Participants consisted primarily of highly educated adults aged 18-40 years. VL scores were negatively associated with younger age (\u03c1 = -0.132, <i>p<\/i> = .002), and positively with higher educational level (\u03c1 = 0196, <i>p<\/i> < .001), higher income (\u03c1 = 0.145, <i>p<\/i> < .001), greater number of information sources consulted (r = 0.104, <i>p<\/i> = .016), and more favorable vaccination outcomes. Conversely, the 3Cs demonstrated inverse significant relationships with the same demographic and behavioral variables. No significant gender differences emerged for either VL or 3Cs measures. Construct validity of the VLBT was supported by the significant negative correlation between VL and 3Cs scores, and with additional confirmation provided through reliability tests and factor analyses. Criterion validity was demonstrated through significant associations between VL scores and vaccination behaviors: number of vaccines received, vaccination recall accuracy, awareness of destination-specific pre-travel vaccination requirements, and influenza vaccination intention. Mediation analysis revealed that the 3Cs partially mediated the relationship between VL and specific vaccination intention outcomes, while demographic characteristics (age, income) and travel-related factors (number of information sources) significantly moderated these associations. The VLBT assessed travelers' VL levels through three simple questions and demonstrated potential clinical utility in travel medicine. By facilitating identification of individuals with limited literacy levels, the new tool can help providers orientate the discussion for a profitable counseling session. Implementation research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in routine travel clinical practice. The high VH revealed in the traveler population warrants future targeted research.","83":"The COVID-19 pandemic and recurring outbreaks of infectious diseases underscore the urgent demand for multiplex diagnostics capable of rapid and accurate pathogen identification. Although multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are widely used for diagnosing diverse infectious diseases, their inherent amplification bias and long turnaround times highlight the demand for faster and reliable alternatives. Here, we present multicolor SATORI (mSATORI), an amplification-free single-molecule genetic test that leverages the complementary activities of CRISPR-Cas13a and Cas13b to achieve simultaneous detection of dual RNA targets. mSATORI identified Influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 RNAs within \u223c10 min, with analytical limits of detection (LoD) of 86 aM and 52 aM, respectively. Validation using clinical specimens demonstrated robust diagnostic performance, achieving femtomolar limits of detection (550 aM for Influenza A and 640 aM for SARS-CoV-2), along with sensitivities exceeding 80% and specificities of 100%. Collectively, these results establish mSATORI as a platform for next-generation molecular diagnostics, with broad implications for clinical implementation, outbreak preparedness, and global infectious disease surveillance.","84":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains a global health crisis, ranking among the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. In response to the World Health Organization's call for therapeutic vaccines to complement antibiotic regimens and reduce tuberculosis (TB) treatment duration, we developed an intranasal DNA vaccine fusing the Mtb stringent response gene relMtb with the gene encoding the dendritic cell-targeting chemokine Mip3a\/CCL20. Administered alongside the first-line regimen, this vaccine accelerated stable cure in immunocompetent murine TB models, reducing lung inflammation and eliciting robust and sustained RelMtb-stimulated T-cell responses systemically and locally. The Mip3a\/relMtb vaccine enhanced dendritic cell recruitment, activation, and spatial coordination with T cells, suggesting improved innate-adaptive immune synergy. Notably, it augmented the efficacy of a novel drug-resistant TB regimen as well. Critically, the vaccine induced analogous antigen-stimulated T-cell immunity in nonhuman primates, the gold standard for preclinical TB vaccine evaluation, with responses detected in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage mirroring those observed in the murine models. These findings underscore the potential of this strategy to advance therapeutic TB vaccine development targeting Mtb persisters while providing a framework to define correlates of vaccine-mediated protection.","85":"Plasma heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan released during endothelial glycocalyx degradation, predicts sepsis mortality. Chondroitin sulfate is a circulating glycosaminoglycan not specific to glycocalyx degradation; its relevance to sepsis is unknown. We studied the associations of plasma chondroitin sulfate with (a) mortality in patients with sepsis-associated hypotension and (b) the relative effectiveness of a randomly-assigned liberal versus restrictive intravenous fluid resuscitation strategy. We selected 574 patients enrolled in the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis trial using an outcome-enriched sampling strategy. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify plasma chondroitin sulfate. In comparison, we measured hyaluronic acid as a glycocalyx degradation marker and IL-6 as an inflammatory biomarker. We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to examine associations of baseline biomarker concentrations with mortality and resuscitation strategy effectiveness. We used inverse probability of selection weights and generalized raking to account for the non-representative sampling design. Plasma chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and IL-6 were associated with mortality within 90 days. As baseline chondroitin sulfate increased, subsequent randomization to a restrictive strategy was increasingly beneficial (p = 0.022): treatment effect hazard ratio (restrictive versus liberal) for mortality was estimated as 1.49 (95% CI 0.98-2.27), 1.30 (1.00-1.69), 1.09 (0.82-1.44), 0.88 (0.66-1.16), and 0.71 (0.52-0.97) for 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles of baseline chondroitin sulfate. Plasma chondroitin sulfate predicts sepsis mortality and may modify the response to a subsequent liberal vs. restrictive intravenous fluid resuscitation strategy. gov NCT03434028.","86":"Early peanut introduction (EPI) is encouraged by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease guidelines and consensus opinion among several allergy associations as a public health measure to decrease peanut allergy. Studies evaluating EPI implementation have found variable impact. To comprehensively evaluate parental understanding, beliefs, barriers, and overall implementation of EPI. For this qualitative study, parents were recruited from primary care academic clinics, federally qualified health centers, and private clinics in Chicago, Illinois, with a focus on adequate representation. Utilizing purposive sampling, all English-speaking parents of infants aged 8 to 13 months were invited to participate. Parents of infants with medical conditions that would alter solid food introduction practices or those involved in other food allergy prevention studies were excluded. Semistructured interviews were conducted with parents from September 2023 to December 2024. Interview questions were structured to follow the Theory of Planned Behavior. All interviews underwent thematic analysis with consensus agreement on all elements. Participation in an interview about EPI. The primary outcome was EPI understanding and implementation utilizing the following Theory of Planned Behavior domains: knowledge, beliefs and opinions, practices, and information sources. A modified grounded theory approach employing the constant comparison method was used to inform thematic analysis and evaluate interviews. Forty-nine interviews were conducted. Participants were primarily mothers (45 participants [92%]). Most parents reported they were at least partially aware of EPI guidelines. Eight major themes emerged: (1) EPI was to evaluate whether the infant was allergic to peanut, (2) EPI was to prevent peanut allergy, (3) family history of food allergy was the main risk factor, (4) EPI is viewed positively, (5) fear of an allergic reaction served as a barrier to EPI, (6) parents had mixed feelings about EPI's overall benefit, (7) EPI was understood and practiced with vide variability, and (8) the pediatrician was the primary source of EPI knowledge. This qualitative study found that although parents were aware of EPI, there was confusion around its purpose, implementation, and risk factors. The main barrier for most parents was the risk of an allergic reaction during EPI. Clear and directive guidance from their pediatrician was a facilitator for successful EPI implementation.","87":"Whipple's disease (WD) is a rare infectious disease caused by Tropheryma whipplei, which primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract but may also involve the joints, central nervous system, and skin. Although cutaneous manifestations are often overlooked, they can provide valuable diagnostic clues. We report the case of a 54-year-old male with long-standing seronegative migratory polyarthritis refractory to conventional treatment, who subsequently developed multiple subcutaneous inflammatory nodules and systemic symptoms. Histopathological examination of these lesions revealed a non-vasculitic, septal-predominant panniculitis with foamy macrophages containing periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive diastase-resistant intracytoplasmic inclusions, raising a strong suspicion of Whipple's disease. Subsequent duodenal biopsies confirmed the diagnosis by electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for T. whipplei. Panniculitis in WD represents a highly specific but rarely reported finding, characterized by thickened subcutaneous septa with partial lobular involvement, foamy macrophage infiltration, and absence of vasculitis. A literature review identified 15 cases of histologically confirmed WD-associated panniculitis, suggesting that this manifestation may be under-recognized in clinical practice. This study underscores the importance of cutaneous pathology in WD and expands current knowledge on its dermatological manifestations by providing clinicopathologic, ultrastructural, and literature-based data.","88":"Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disorder. Severe psoriasis is treated with systemic immunosuppressive agents. Systemic immunosuppression increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB) disease. Sudden cessation of immunosuppression seems logical in a TB patient but can lead to psoriasis flares. And when a new rash occurs during TB therapy, drug reaction is usually suspected. This can result in untreated TB disease or intermittent therapy, thus increasing the risk for acquired drug resistance. We describe two patients who developed TB disease during immunosuppressive therapy for psoriasis. When the immunosuppressive therapy was stopped, due to TB disease, both patients experienced significant worsening of psoriasis. The skin changes were confused with drug reaction to TB medications. Significant treatment interruptions resulted. A single team of TB physicians and one dermatologist, worked in conjunction to formulate a psoriasis and TB treatment plan. The patients were treated with acitretin and cyclosporine systemically along with topical agents to achieve psoriasis control. Then both were sequentially challenged with one TB medication at a time to ensure no drug reaction occurred while monitored at Texas Center for Infectious Disease. Cyclosporine was then tapered off. Both patients tolerated the alternative psoriasis regimen and TB therapy well. Both demonstrated clinical, bacteriologic, and radiographic improvement. Treatment of TB disease in patients with severe psoriasis requires a collaborative effort between the TB treatment team and dermatology. A balanced approach, including treatment of both diseases, is necessary to avoid confusion of psoriasis flare versus drug induced skin reactions from TB medications.","89":"Sporotrichosis oculoglandular syndrome is an infectious disease caused by the thermodimorphic fungus <i>Sporothrix<\/i> species. Humans can become accidentally infected through vegetative trauma and contact with cats. However, there are no reported cases of this disease being transmitted by insects. In this report, we present a case of insect-related sporotrichosis oculoglandular syndrome.","90":"The incidence of bacterial resistance is a serious global health concern because it reduces the effectiveness of antibiotics and complicates the treatment of infectious diseases. Mastitis is one of the most common and economically significant diseases in the dairy industry, leading to reduced milk yield, altered milk quality, and financial losses for farmers. Antibiotics are commonly used for mastitis treatment, but their excessive or inappropriate use can accelerate the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). <i>Escherichia coli<\/i>, a major foodborne pathogen, is also recognized as an important causative agent of bovine mastitis, with contamination often originating from milk and dairy products. This study investigated the antimicrobial resistance of <i>E. coli<\/i> isolated from dairy cows with subclinical mastitis in the Licin Subdistrictto provide information on suitable antimicrobial treatment for mastitis. Exploratory laboratory research was conducted using purposive sampling. Milk samples from lactating Holstein Friesian dairy cows were screened for subclinical mastitis using the California mastitis test (CMT). Samples with CMT scores of +++ and ++++ were processed for <i>E. coli<\/i> isolation using eosin methylene blue agar, Gram staining, and Indole, Methyl Red, Voges Proskauer, and Citrate biochemical tests. Resistance testing against different antibiotics was conducted using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique. A total of 29 milk samples were examined; 17 (58.6%) samples tested positive for subclinical mastitis. Among the 17 subclinical mastitis-positive samples, 4 (23.5%) were positive for <i>E. coli<\/i>. Antibiotic resistance testing of the <i>E. coli<\/i> isolates showed 100%, 25%, and 25% resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, and streptomycin, respectively. All <i>E. coli<\/i> isolates (100%) were sensitive to aztreonam, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and ciprofloxacin. The antibiotic resistance patterns observed in <i>E. coli<\/i> isolates pose significant challenges for mastitis treatment in dairy farms. Although complete resistance to erythromycin limits therapeutic options, the maintained sensitivity to aztreonam, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and ciprofloxacin provides viable alternatives. These findings emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship and routine resistance monitoring to preserve effective treatment options and ensure sustainable dairy production.","91":"Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly infectious disease affecting multiple avian species worldwide. Repeated ND outbreaks in Pakistan have presented substantial challenges to the poultry sector. Extensive surveillance in Pakistan over a decade has revealed a high prevalence of avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOAV-1), highlighting the need for tailored vaccination approaches and continuous monitoring. This study presented a 10-year biosurveillance (2011-2020) of AOAV-1 across 1083 locations (including commercial farms, backyard poultry, live bird retail stalls, household birds, national zoos, and wild migratory birds), with a total of 5,145 samples (trachea and oropharyngeal swabs) and 822 blood samples collected from 18 avian species. Tracheal and swab samples were inoculated in embryonated chicken eggs, and the positive allantoic fluids were assessed for AOAV-1 prevalence using reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR (rRT-PCR) targeting the fusion (<i>F<\/i>) gene. Serum samples were evaluated using a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test to detect AOAV-1 antibodies. rRT-PCR analysis showed a prevalence of 37.41%, while seroprevalence assessed through the HI assay was 48%. Moreover, over a decade after repeated outbreaks of virulent AOAV-1 that resulted in high morbidity and mortality in Pakistan, the responsible strain was detected in vaccinated chickens across multiple commercial poultry farms, despite the existence of elevated AOAV-1-specific antibody titers (>4.6 log<sub>2<\/sub>). The observations suggest a possible role of vaccinated poultry as a reservoir of virulent AOAV-1. These findings contribute to our understanding of the high prevalence of AOAV-1 in Pakistan, emphasizing the need for customized vaccination approaches and continuous monitoring to enable effective management of AOAV-1 in avian species.","92":"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious viral infection in rabbits that can occur in acute, subacute, chronic, or peracute forms and is not fatal. It is caused by RHD virus (RHDV), a member of the genus <i>Lagovirus<\/i> in the family <i>Caliciviridae<\/i>, with variants including RHDV1, RHDV1a, and RHDV2. First identified in 1984 in domestic rabbits (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus<\/i>) in China, RHD has since been reported in Asia, Europe, Africa, Central America, and North America. Both innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to host defense, although rapid disease progression can limit adaptive immunity. Carcasses of affected rabbits often retain adequate fat reserves, indicating that death occurs before the development of cachexia. The liver and spleen are the most frequent gross lesions, with hepatic necrosis as the predominant finding. Diagnosis is confirmed through postmortem examination and laboratory testing, with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) being the most sensitive method for detecting viral RNA. Transmission occurs via direct contact, aerosol inhalation, contaminated food or water ingestion, ocular exposure, and contact with fomites. The virus is shed in respiratory secretions, feces, and urine, thereby enabling its rapid spread. Mortality rates range from 70% to 90%, leading to a significant decline in wild rabbit populations. No specific antiviral treatment exists, and control relies on strict biosecurity, quarantine, environmental disinfection, and vaccination. Strain-specific and bivalent vaccines remain the most effective preventive measures, particularly in regions where RHDV2 is endemic. Continuous surveillance is essential for mitigating ecological and economic impacts.","93":"On September 17, 2024, a coordinated detonation of approximately 5,000 pager devices in Lebanon produced a large mass-casualty incident. Devices contained pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). We report 5 pediatric patients transferred to a tertiary referral center for management of complex multisystem injuries. We performed a brief report of 5 children (<12 years) referred to Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran. Demographics, injury pattern, surgical interventions, and short-term outcomes (up to 3 months) were abstracted from medical records. All patients received multidisciplinary care (ophthalmology, plastic surgery, orthopedics, otolaryngology, pediatrics, infectious disease). Mean age was 9.2 years (range 5-11). All 5 children sustained ocular, facial, and hand injuries. Three eyes were auto-eviscerated, and 4 children underwent partial hand amputations. Multiple operative procedures were required per patient (ocular surgery, facial reconstruction, orthopedic fixation). Early outcomes were poor for vision and hand function in the majority; reconstructive planning and prosthetic rehabilitation were anticipated for longer-term care. Close-range exposure to small PETN-containing devices produced a distinctive pediatric injury pattern dominated by severe ocular and upper-extremity trauma. These findings emphasize the need for pediatric-focused acute care algorithms and sustained rehabilitation resources after blast incidents.","94":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global threat to public health, though AI models have shown transformative potential in combating AMR. China's DeepSeek, a novel open-source, low-cost, and locally deployable AI model, is increasingly integrated into clinical workflows for infectious diseases, yet the pharmacological validity and real-world impact of its recommended drugs remain poorly understood. This study aimed to compare the antibacterial regimens among DeepSeek(V3,R1,R1\u2009+\u2009WS), ChatGPT o1, and infectious disease (ID) specialists, while evaluating the performance, timeliness of the two AI models. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 101 cases with effective antibacterial therapy. DeepSeek and ChatGPT o1 were identically prompted using comprehensive case data to generate antibacterial regimens. Then, Five independent clinical pharmacists evaluated all outputs. The benchmark evaluation metrics included the concordance rate between two AI models and the patient's effective antibacterial regimens, as well as the proportion of regimens escalating therapy to higher-tier groups per WHO's AWaRe classification. Furthermore, performance metrics encompassed overlap rate, precision, recall, F1-score, ID specialists endorsement rate, search latency, and search success rate of DeepSeek and ChatGPT o1. Statistical analyses employed Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests. DeepSeek-V3 demonstrated the highest overall concordance rate with ID specialists, exceeding those of DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT o1. The proportion of antibacterial regimens escalated to higher-tier groups was significantly greater in DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1\u2009+\u2009WS and ChatGPT o1 compared to that of ID specialists(P\u2009<\u20090.005). Regarding the performance metrics, ChatGPT o1 achieved the highest level of overlap rate, while DeepSeek-R1 led in recall. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 achieved the optimal F1-score and the highest overall ID specialists' endorsed rate, reflecting optimal balance. Likewise, Search latency varied substantially (H\u2009=\u2009305.53, P\u2009<\u20090.005), with DeepSeek-V3 and ChatGPT o1 exhibiting the fastest response times. While moderate agreement exists between DeepSeek and ID specialists in antibiotic selection, DeepSeek models exhibit a marked tendency toward recommending higher-tier, broader-spectrum antibacterials. Moreover, DeepSeek's antibacterial clinical decision-making is comparable to that of ChatGPT o1, with DeepSeek-V3 surpassing it in certain performance metrics. These findings highlight the need for AI refinement to align with stewardship principles and contextual clinical judgment.

These immersive technologies show promise in enhancing infection prevention and control, especially during infectious disease outbreaks. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current application of XR technologies in infection control education, identifying key trends, benefits, and limitations of VR and AR-based interventions. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on January 12, 2025, for the Web of Science and PubMed databases using keywords related to hygiene, infection prevention, and XR technologies. An initial pool of 162 articles was screened, resulting in 38 studies that met inclusion criteria. These studies were descriptively analyzed to assess their contributions, focus areas, and outcomes. The review indicates most studies show XR tools effectively improve practical skills, behaviors, or attitudes, while a smaller number reveal limited or no significant gains, especially in knowledge and compliance. This result shows that XR tools have the potential to improve knowledge retention, practical skills, and provide real-time feedback, outperforming traditional training methods. XR tools specifically enhanced hand hygiene, proper use of personal protective equipment, and emergency response training, areas critical during outbreaks like COVID-19. Nevertheless, widespread adoption remains limited due to the need for more long-term efficacy data and strategies for integrating XR into standard curricula. To fully realize this potential, it is essential to address existing limitations related to cost, safety, and validation, while establishing robust frameworks for curriculum integration and policy implementation. XR technologies play a crucial role in advancing infection control education by offering potential benefits for healthcare training and education. Future research should prioritize evaluating long-term outcomes and developing effective implementation strategies to facilitate broader adoption, maximize their educational impact and, and mitigate potential barriers.

During this time, healthcare workers scrambled to respond to the outbreak amidst a lack of resources, knowledge gaps and pressures related to COVID-19. This period posed a risk of heightened moral distress, defined as distress arising from a situation in which a healthcare worker knows the right thing to do but is externally constrained from doing so. An international survey of healthcare workers was developed to understand their experiences of responding to mpox, including open-text questions regarding moral distress. Drawing on thematic analysis of these open text responses, this paper conceptualises the forms of distress experienced by health workers as 'outbreak distress'-an emotional and psychological response to the synergistic effects that arise from stressed systems, uncertainty and stigma that characterise many, and especially new, infectious disease outbreaks. In the context of pandemic preparedness, outbreak distress represents a novel concept for understanding additional pressures on healthcare systems in future unknown and re-emerging outbreaks.","97":"GIM\/FP\/GP: [Formula: see text] Infectious Disease: [Formula: see text] Pulmonology: [Formula: see text].","98":"Since antimicrobial shortages are becoming common owing to manufacturing issues and sudden demand, individualized antimicrobial optimization by infectious disease specialists is essential. We evaluated the effects of a 12-month antimicrobial stewardship program at a university-affiliated hospital in Japan during antimicrobial shortages. In this single-center retrospective observational study, from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2025, we compared the pre-intervention (antimicrobial stewardship program without infectious disease specialists) and post-intervention (antimicrobial stewardship program with infectious disease specialists and formal consultation service) periods. The evaluated outcomes included antimicrobial use, microbiological indicators (number of culture specimens submitted and hospital-acquired resistant organisms), patient outcomes (in-hospital mortality and length of hospital stay), and antimicrobial costs. A Bayesian structural time-series analysis adjusted for seasonality was used to assess intervention effects. In total, 24,601 inpatients were included (11,782 before intervention and 12,819 after). Shortages affected nine intravenous and two oral antibiotics. The antimicrobial stewardship program team provided 1110 feedback instances (acceptance rate, 74.1%) and conducted 172 infectious disease consultations in the post-intervention period. Carbapenem use, antipseudomonal agent use, incidence of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the cost of carbapenems per patient-day significantly decreased. Narrow-spectrum antibiotic use, anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agent use, all intravenous antimicrobial use, total intravenous and oral antimicrobials, and the number of inpatient specimens were significantly increased. All antimicrobial costs, in-hospital mortality, and length of hospital stay remained unchanged. Antimicrobial stewardship program supported by infectious disease specialists\/consultants significantly reduced carbapenem and antipseudomonal agent use without negatively affecting patient outcomes. These findings highlight infectious disease specialists' critical role in supporting effective antimicrobial stewardship programs, particularly during limited antimicrobial supply and increased clinical complexity.","99":"Chagas disease is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, with heart failure being a severe complication of its chronic stage. T. cruzi has three lifecycle stages: epimastigote, trypomastigote, and amastigote. Amastigotes are the intracellular form that invade mammalian host cells, replicate in their cytoplasm, and cause tissue damage. Due to the small size of T. cruzi amastigotes, fine spatial resolution would be beneficial. Current metabolomics research on Chagas disease primarily focuses on studying metabolites through widely used bulk analysis techniques such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). However, conducting comprehensive molecular studies of Chagas disease is constrained by the inherent limitations, including sample loss and lack of spatial resolution, of these traditional analytical tools. Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) is an advanced analytical method that combines ambient sampling and ionization with mass spectrometry to produce spatially resolved chemical maps of sample surfaces.
