We elucidate the role of trogocytosis-related CLDN18.2 in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression. We constructed humanised hCD34<sup>+<\/sup>, Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>Pdx1-cre (KPC), Cldn18.2 knockout (KO), and patient-derived xenograft\/organoid mouse models. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, single-cell RNA-sequencing and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) were performed. CLDN18.2<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells indicated poor pancreatic cancer prognosis and immunotherapeutic resistance. CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells acquired CLDN18.2 from tumour cells via trogocytosis, inhibiting their activation and cytotoxicity. \"Dressed\" CLDN18.2 suppressed glucose uptake, glycolysis and cytotoxicity of tumour-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Mechanically, trogocytosis-related CLDN18.2 induced GSK3\u03b2\/CK1\u03b1-mediated \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation, promoting \u03b2-catenin ubiquitination and proteasome degradation in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. CLDN18.2 interacted with \u03b2-catenin's N-terminal domain via its C-terminal domain, further strengthening the interaction between \u03b2-catenin and CK1\u03b1. Moreover, CLDN18.2<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells preferentially 'homed' to the bone marrow through the CXCL12\/CXCR4 axis, skewed haematopoietic stem cell myeloid differentiation and induced systemic immune senescence via IL1\u03b1. Notably, preclinical mouse studies showed PC18.1 peptide sensitised immunotherapy and suppressed PDAC progression by disrupting the CLDN18.2\/\u03b2-catenin interaction in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Trogocytosis-related CLDN18.2 inhibited the glucose uptake, glycolysis and cytotoxicity of tumour-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells by promoting the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of \u03b2-catenin in PDAC. Therefore, targeting trogocytosis-related CLDN18.2<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells may be a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit PDAC progression.","1":"Infectious diseases remain a global health challenge, driven by increasing antimicrobial-resistance and the threat of emerging epidemics. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus are leading causes of mortality worldwide. Trained immunity-a form of innate immune memory-offers a promising approach to enhance pathogen clearance. Here, we demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 induces trained immunity in human monocytes through a mechanism involving mTORC1 activation, glutaminolysis, and epigenetic remodeling. Macrophages derived from IFN-\u03b3-trained monocytes exhibited increased glycolytic activity with enhanced cytokine and chemokine responses upon stimulation or infection. Crucially, trained macrophages had increased production of reactive oxygen species which mediated enhanced bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Furthermore, ATAC-sequencing analysis of IFN-\u03b3 trained macrophages revealed increased chromatin accessibility in regions associated with host defence. Lastly, IFN-\u03b3 training restored impaired innate responses in macrophages from individuals homozygous for the TIRAP 180L polymorphism, a genetic variant associated with increased susceptibility to infection. These findings establish IFN-\u03b3 as a potent inducer of trained immunity in human monocytes and support its potential as a host-directed strategy to strengthen antimicrobial defenses, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals and high-risk clinical contexts.","2":"Latently infected cells persist in people living with HIV (PWH) despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and evade immune clearance. Shock and Kill cure strategies are hampered by insufficient enhancement of targeted immune responses following latency reversal. We previously demonstrated autologous V\u03b42 T cells from PWH retain anti-HIV activity and can reduce CD4+ T cell reservoirs, although their use in cure approaches is limited due to their dual role as a viral reservoir. However, promising clinical data in oncology shows their unique MHC- unrestricted antigen recognition affords potent on-target cytotoxicity in the absence of graft-versus-host disease when used as an allogeneic adoptive cell therapy modality. Here, we found expanded allogeneic V\u03b42 T cells specifically eliminated HIV-infected CD4+ T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), overcoming inherent resistance to killing by other cell types such as NK and CD8+ T cells. Notably, we demonstrated allogeneic V\u03b42 T cells recognized and eliminated the HIV-latent CD4+ T cell reservoir following latency reversal. Our study provides evidence for developing an allogeneic \u03b3\u03b4 T cell therapy for HIV cure and warrants pre-clinical investigation in combination approaches.","3":"Dysfunctional white adipose tissue contributes to the development of obesity-related morbidities, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and other metabolic disorders. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) accumulate in obesity and play both beneficial and harmful roles in the maintenance of adipose tissue homeostasis and function. Despite their importance, the molecules and mechanisms that regulate these diverse functions are not well understood. Lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs), the dominant subset of obesity-associated ATMs, accumulate in crown-like structures and are characterized by a metabolically activated and proinflammatory phenotype. We previously identified CD9 as a surface marker of LAMs. However, the contribution of CD9 to the activation and function of LAMs during obesity is unknown. Using a myeloid-specific CD9 knockout model, we show that CD9 supports ATM-adipocyte adhesion and crown-like structure formation. Furthermore, CD9 promotes the expression of pro-fibrotic and extracellular matrix remodeling genes. Loss of myeloid CD9 reduces adipose tissue fibrosis, increases visceral adipose tissue accumulation, and improves global metabolic outcomes during diet-induced obesity. These results identify CD9 as a causal regulator of pathogenic LAM functions, highlighting CD9 as a potential therapeutic target for treating obesity-associated metabolic disease.","4":"No abstract available","5":"No abstract available","6":"There is a poor response of prostate cancer to immunotherapies because of dysfunctions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics, like abnormal vasculature structure, stiffened\u00a0stroma, increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), and regions of hypoxia. However, the existing computational modelings are unable to tackle this issue, as they are based on two-dimensional (2D) geometry that ignores TME properties (like TME biphasic composition) and interaction between cancer and immune cells. To address this knowledge gap, this paper offers a patient-specific multiphysics model for prostate cancer. The proposed model is based on three-dimensional (3D) geometry obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and combines three complementary approaches to normalizing the tumor microenvironment: vascular normalization via anti-angiogenic therapy, stromal normalization via extracellular matrix softening, and immune checkpoint blockade. One important new aspect of this work is that new nanoparticle delivery models have been developed for 20-100 nm nanoparticles (NP) delivering immunotherapy agents. These equations explicitly incorporate interactions between the components of the TME and directly account for mechanical stress induced by tumor growth, enabling mathematical modeling of physical TME changes and their subsequent impact on the dynamics of immune cells (such as cytotoxic T cells (CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells), regulatory T cells (Treg), and pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1-like)\/anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2-like) and cancer cells. This capability is absent in previous models. The other important novelty is that for the first time in a prostate cancer model, factors for vascular and stromal normalization and immunotherapy have been incorporated in a 3D geometry. The parameters of this model have been optimized based on literature and preclinical trial data related to immunology and tumors. The sensitivity analysis has confirmed that all therapeutic factors, optimized vascular function (functional vessel density increases from 43 to 112 cm<sup>2<\/sup>\/cm<sup>3<\/sup>), reduced stromal solid stress (decrease in shear modulus from 10.4 to 6.1 kPa), as well as a 70% reduction in IFP (from 1471 to 441 Pa), in combination contribute to a 30% increase in accumulation of nanoparticles in the tumor, 60% increase in the ratio of CD8\u2009+\u2009\/Tregs, a 45% decrease in the ratio of M1\/M2 macrophages, a 15% reduction in the tumor hypoxia gradient, and a 40% decrease in the size of the tumor within 50 days. This model can thus provide a clinically applicable tool for predicting the efficacy of nano-immunotherapy in prostate cancer. Experimental confirmation is required to better evaluate NP toxicity.","7":"The clinical features of viral respiratory infections in individuals with rheumatic immune diseases, renal diseases, hematological diseases, and healthy individuals were analyzed. Additionally, the impact of immunosuppressive therapy on the clinical manifestations of viral respiratory infections was explored. Patients attending the outpatient clinic of the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology at Suzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from October 1, 2023, to May 1, 2024, as well as healthy individuals undergoing physical examinations, were selected for the study. Data were collected through questionnaires, including information on viral respiratory infections, vaccination status, clinical symptoms, and medication use. A total of 425 questionnaires were collected. There were significant differences among groups in recovery time, disease classification, vaccination rates, and specific clinical symptoms (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05). Immunosuppressive therapy significantly reduced the incidence of runny nose (<i>p<\/i> = 0.046) and chills (<i>p<\/i> < 0.001) but was associated with a higher proportion of ordinary cases, suggesting that it may be associated with increased disease severity (<i>p<\/i> = 0.012). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the use of glucocorticoids significantly prolonged both recovery time (<i>p<\/i> = 0.007) and duration of cough (<i>p<\/i> = 0.044). The rheumatology group experienced shorter recovery time (<i>p<\/i> = 0.016) and a lower risk of fever (38\u00b0C-39\u00b0C), whereas the hematology group had an increased risk of high fever (>39\u00b0C; <i>p<\/i> = 0.037). Vaccination significantly increased the likelihood of mild cases (<i>p<\/i> = 0.041), serving as an important protective factor. Additionally, younger patients and females tended to exhibit relatively more severe clinical manifestations. Significant differences between the groups existed in terms of symptomatology, clinical symptoms, and time to recovery, and the use of immunosuppressive therapy, especially glucocorticoids, may have exacerbated the patient's condition. Vaccination provided a protective effect for patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, mitigating the condition to a certain extent.","8":"The resistance or susceptibility to various infectious and parasitic diseases is associated with the genetic polymorphisms of major histocompatibility complex Class I (MHCI) gene. The extensive practice of breeding farm animals over centuries to satisfy food demand, while largely overlooking the enhancement of disease resistance through selective breeding, has resulted in a diminished genetic capacity of these animals to combat pathogens. The study seeks to understand the global research trends using published information on MHCI gene in farm animals (cattle, goats, sheep, chicken, geese, ducks, horses and donkeys), which may identify strengths and weaknesses in research initiatives directed towards finding solutions. The Year 2014 emerged as the only year with the greatest number of publications and citations. The production output of articles over time showed that the United States of America and the United Kingdom were found to be leading in this regard. Topics that involved 'Nucleotide sequence,' 'genes' and 'MHC Class I' were identified to be extremely underrepresented and changing quickly. Topics with high impact but with no specialisation included 'animals,' 'article,' 'non-human,' 'female,' 'animal,' 'experiment' and 'bovine.' A blend of underrepresented terms and specialised ones will enhance future topics, leading to more significant research outcomes. China and Africa must establish robust collaborations to advance MHCI studies in goats.","9":"No abstract available","10":"To evaluate longitudinal trends in Urology In-Service Examination (ISE) from 2016 to 2023 and identify changes in performance patterns over time. Retrospective cohort analysis of aggregate ISE scores provided by the American Urological Association. Mean percent-correct scores across postgraduate years (PGY1-5) and subtopics were analyzed from 2016 to 2023. 2020 was used as a temporal marker for the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in sub-analyses. Two-sample t-tests determined statistical significance (\u03b1 \u2264 0.05). A total of 680 scores were analyzed. Mean scores increased with PGY level (43-46% in PGY1 to 68-71% in PGY5) but declined over time. Linear trend analysis showed a statistically significant decline for PGY2-5, with the steepest and strongest correlation seen in PGY3-5. Subtopic declines were most notable in calculous disease (64.2% to 56.1%, p=0.01) and physiology\/immunology\/adrenal (70.2% to 56.5%, p<0.001), both affecting all PGY levels. Additional decreases were noted in pediatrics (PGY2-4), congenital anomalies\/embryology\/anatomy (PGY1-2, 4), and imaging (PGY3-4). In contrast, PGY1 scores in fluid & electrolytes\/transplant\/hypertension\/vascular\/nephrology improved modestly (50.5% vs. 56.0%, p=0.05). Performance on 217 repeated questions was stable (69.3% vs. 69.7%). Mean ISE performance declined from 2016 to 2023 across all PGY levels, with the greatest decreases observed in general urology subtopics. Scores after 2020 were lower across most PGY levels and content domains, while performance on repeated questions remained stable. These trends may reflect increased examination difficulty, expanded content, changes in question composition, evolving study strategies, and variability in clinical exposure rather than diminished knowledge.","11":"Spatial transcriptomics maps whole-transcriptome profiles directly onto tissue sections, correlating between cellular neighborhoods and gene expression and how these activities drive health and disease. Although the approach has transformed oncology, neuroscience, immunology, developmental sciences, and many fields, it has been less widely used in vascular biology, even though vascular disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Two obstacles stand out: arteries and veins offer little flat surface for sectioning, and diseased specimens, often atherosclerotic, thrombosed, plaque-laden, or calcified, require harsh treatments such as decalcification that jeopardize morphology and RNA integrity. Yet these same vessels, with their concentric intima, media, and adventitia layered structures, are ideal for spatial analysis because each layer hosts distinct cell types and gene programs that interact across the wall. Few detailed protocols address how to prepare vascular tissues for spatial transcriptomics. This shortage limits researchers' ability to exploit the technique's full potential. To bridge the gap, we present a step-by-step workflow optimized for human tibial arteries with advanced lesions. The protocol covers tissue handling, fixation, and proper decalcification that preserve structure and RNA quality, followed by histological staining to grade calcification severity. We also describe the construction of tissue microarray (TMA) to curb batch effects and region of interest (ROI) selection strategies on the NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP). By lowering technical barriers, this protocol enables vascular researchers to generate reliable spatial transcriptomic data and study layer-specific transcriptional activities in healthy and diseased vessels. We anticipate that it will accelerate the discovery of mechanisms underlying calcification, inflammation, intimal atherosclerosis, and other vascular pathologies and foster broader adoption of spatial transcriptomics in vascular biology.","12":"Immune escape mechanisms critically restrict the efficacy of immunotherapy in lung cancer (LC), with only 20%-30% of patients responding to checkpoint inhibitors. To systematically map global trends and identify emerging hotspots, this study analyzed 2813 publications related to immune escape in LC immunotherapy from 1995 to 2025 (data retrieved August 9, 2025; analysis of annual trends uses complete year data through 2024) sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Bibliometric visualization was performed using VOSviewer (version 1.6.19), CiteSpace (version 6.2.R3), and the biblioshiny R package. The dataset encompassed 75 countries, 3421 institutions, and 18,023 researchers across 693 journals. Publication trends delineated three distinct phases: an initial phase (1995-2010), an acceleration phase (2011-2018), and a maturation phase (2019-2024). China dominates in publication volume (1,382 papers) and total citations (45,657), whereas the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center emerged as the most influential institution (n\u2009=\u200987). The <i>Frontiers in Immunology<\/i> recorded the highest number of publications (n\u2009=\u2009155), while <i>Cancer Research<\/i> received the most co-citations (6,149). Li Zhang ranks as the most prolific author with 19 publications and 1251 citations, while R.S. Herbst holds the highest number of co-citations (n\u2009=\u2009628). Current research clusters focus primarily on \"therapeutic strategies and treatment integration,\" \"tumor microenvironment characterization and immune cell dynamics,\" and \"translational biomarkers and precision immunotherapy.\" Future research emphasizes \"spatial microenvironment architecture,\" \"computational predictive modeling,\" \"alternative cell death pathways,\" \"precision biomarker development,\" \"hypoxia-immune interactions,\" and \"stemness-EMT immune interfaces.\" Overall, the field's exponential growth and geographic disparities provide a structural foundation for developing strategies to overcome immune escape mechanisms by integrating spatial microenvironment characterization with advanced computational modeling.","13":"Understanding immunology requires assimilating a considerable amount of theory. However, adapting the narrative of immunological processes from a human perspective and using accessible language can facilitate an authentic connection with the content, promoting creative teaching. From this viewpoint, an innovative format of micro-narratives is presented: the educational pitch-stories. These communication strategies can motivate while addressing complex topics in a short time. Those introduced here explain the activation, movement, and communication of cells through different manifestations of resilience: the creative resilience of neutrophils, physical resilience in cellular trafficking, and built resilience in the germinal center. This kind of trailer can organize and energize lectures, making the teaching-learning process a more motivating, engaging, meaningful, and flexible experience. From this perspective, new educational tools that combine creativity, shortness, and precision are suggested to guide students toward an understanding of the dynamics of immune responses.","14":"Restricted feeding mitigates metabolic diseases and offers a cost-saving potential for broiler production. This study investigated a feeding strategy to reduce costs without compromising health. Four hundred and eighty one-day-old male broilers were divided into four groups subjected to 21-day feed restriction with different daily access times (24, 20, 16, or 12 h), followed by <i>ad libitum<\/i> feeding for 24 h (ADF) until 70 days. Early feed restriction (EFR) significantly decreased body weight, average daily gain, feed intake, and bursa of Fabricius index (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05), while suppressing intestinal Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway and enhancing inflammatory responses. Subsequent ADF reversed these effects, restoring growth performance and immune indices to control levels. Butyric acid and butyrate-producing bacteria increased significantly (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05), accompanied by activated Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway and enriched beneficial flora. In conclusion, ADF alleviates EFR-induced inflammation and promotes immune recovery via gut microbiota and Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway, providing a viable cost-effective feeding strategy.","15":"High-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is treated with intravesical instillations of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), which trigger a local immune response. Improved patient outcomes have been linked to the recruitment of CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T helper type 1 (Th1) cells to the bladder. However, specific antigens recognized by the bladder-infiltrating T cells remain largely unknown. In this study, we followed thirty-two patients with NMIBC undergoing BCG immunotherapy. Longitudinal blood and urine samples were collected to investigate the dynamics and characteristics of BCG-specific T cells. We detected pre-existing BCG-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells in most BCG therapy-naive patients before treatment induction. BCG immunotherapy increased the frequency and memory differentiation of circulating BCG-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, which displayed a polyfunctional Th1 phenotype. Importantly, we provide evidence that BCG-specific CD4<sup>+<\/sup> Th1 cells can be detected in urine during therapy, suggesting their recruitment to the bladder. This study provides novel biological insights into the cellular mechanisms of BCG-induced immunity in bladder cancer.","16":"Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT) for primary immunodeficiency reduces infection risk and subsequent complications and can be lifesaving. However, IRT can cause severe systemic adverse events (AEs) that may limit adequate dosing. These AEs may be caused, in part, by activation and\/or consumption of complement proteins, thereby lowering C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) levels. Data suggest that C1-INH administration prior to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may reduce IVIG-related AEs. This case describes an adult with common variable immunodeficiency unable to tolerate IRT therapy (subcutaneous immunoglobulin [SCIG] 20% solution once weekly). She experienced AEs of severe neuropathy, described as burning and pins-and-needles sensation in the extremities and muscle twitching for several days post-treatment. Dose decreases of SCIG to 0.5\u2009g did not improve the AE profile. Inability to tolerate IRT caused suboptimal dosing and inadequate primary immunodeficiency management, resulting in hospitalizations for pneumonia and sepsis. A trial of recombinant human C1-INH 4200\u2009U was administered intravenously over approximately 5\u2009min, 1\u2009h prior to SCIG 1\u2009g (Day 1). This dose was well tolerated with minimal AEs reported. SCIG 3\u2009g was administered on Days 2 and 3 with no AEs reported. By continuing routine recombinant human C1-INH 4200\u2009U prophylaxis, the patient was able to tolerate the recommended dose of SCIG 20\u2009g once weekly without the debilitating neuropathy and other AEs previously experienced with SCIG alone. This case suggests that a patient with IRT-related AEs may benefit from C1-INH replacement therapy prior to SCIG\/IVIG administration to improve tolerability.","17":"The relationship between Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and sleep health is unclear; therefore, we examined the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and sleep impairment in Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries. The Epidemiology, Immunology, and Clinical Characteristics of Emerging Infections of Pandemic Potential study enrolled MHS beneficiaries through Military Treatment Facilities and an online pathway. Eligibility criteria included those who were Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive or negative. A subset of participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire in addition to the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) instruments. Bivariate analyses of PSQI score with COVID-19 history were extended by multivariable regression models to adjust for confounders. Sensitivity analyses adjusted for GAD-7, PHQ-9, and prior sleep disorders. A total of 1228 Epidemiology, Immunology, and Clinical Characteristics of Emerging Infectious Diseases with Pandemic Potential participants completed a PSQI questionnaire. Over half were males (64%), white (77%), and Active-Duty Service Members (ADSM) (80%). The median age was 37\u00a0years, and 41% of the participants had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to completing the PSQI. Those with prior infection were more likely to have poor sleep health (PSQI > 10) compared to those without (32% vs 21%, <i>p<\/i> < .001). After adjusting for sex, race, age, BMI, and history of obstructive sleep apnea, those with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher risk of poor sleep [PSQI > 10: RR\u2009=\u20091.41, <i>p<\/i> < .001]. Results were similar across all sensitivity analyses. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with poor sleep in ADSM and MHS beneficiaries. Further prospective and mechanistic studies are required to further understand this association.","18":"Periodontitis (PD) affects over 1 billion people globally, underscoring the need for valid animal models. This study aimed to (1) systematically compare single-cell immune landscapes between human PD and murine ligature models, and (2) evaluate whether <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis<\/i> (Pg) supplementation improves model translatability. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of murine gingival tissues from ligature, ligature+Pg, and control groups, integrated with human data, distinct immune profiles between murine and human PD was identified: (1) Murine models showed significantly lower B\/plasma cell \u0394(PD-Ctrl) proportions than human (murine 0.10% vs. human 22.39%, <i>p<\/i> < 0.001) and attenuated activation states; (2) Conversely, the change in macrophages \u0394(PD-Ctrl) is significantly greater in mice (murine 28.53% vs. human -6.603%, <i>p<\/i> < 0.0001) and exhibited hyperactivation; (3) Co-administration of Pg did not reduce the immunological distinctions between mice and humans. (<i>p<\/i> > 0.05). These findings reveal immunological disparities in murine ligature models from human PD, suggesting to approach with caution when using these models for studying immune interactions in PD.","19":"Cholera toxin has a biologically active A subunit and a binding B subunit. Being non-toxigenic, the Cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit has multiple applications in immunology and rapid diagnostics. A recombinant form of CTB (rCTB) is available for commercial use. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a severe global shortage in the production and distribution of commercial CTB, which posed a significant problem for researchers worldwide. Due to the non-availability of commercial rCTB post the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, we attempted and successfully produced rCTB in a pET-based expression system in <i>Escherichia\u00a0coli<\/i>. To the best of our knowledge, production of rCTB in a pET-based expression system in <i>E. coli<\/i>\u00a0is reported for the first time in India. The <i>ctx<\/i>B gene was amplified from\u00a0toxigenic <i>Vibrio\u00a0cholerae<\/i>\u00a0and cloned into the pET-24a(+) plasmid and inserted into <i>E. coli<\/i>\u00a0DH5\u03b1. The plasmid was extracted, and the cloned gene from the pET-24a(+) vector was amplified and Sanger sequenced. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into <i>E. coli<\/i>\u00a0BL21(DE3) and induced at different temperatures and concentrations of IPTG. The optimum time, temperature, and IPTG concentration were identified, and the rCTB protein was expressed in large culture and purified using Ni-NTA chromatography and dialysed.\u00a0The protein was sequenced and confirmed as rCTB using LC-MS. Specific primers designed for the CTB gene amplified a product with the expected size of 341 bp. DNA sequencing confirmed the identity and correct orientation of CTB in the construct and translated using the Expasy translate tool. Optimum conditions for induction were 1mM IPTG, 16\u2103 for 16 hours. Confirmation of protein was done by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The protein matched with cholera enterotoxin subunit B of <i>V. cholerae<\/i> serotype O1 (strain ATCC 39315) with a score of 82, and the induced protein was confirmed as rCTB. Multiple independent inductions yielded a total protein of ~1+\/- 0.1mg per liter of induced culture. The\u00a0<i>E. coli<\/i> pET-24a(+) plasmid-based expression system is a practical and efficient method for producing\u00a0rCTB.","20":"As public interest in health and immunology grows, short video platforms have become an increasingly important source of medical information. Kawasaki disease, a pediatric immune-mediated vasculitis with potential cardiovascular complications, has attracted substantial attention; however, the accuracy and quality of related content on these platforms remain unexamined. This study aimed to evaluate the overall quality of Kawasaki disease-related videos on TikTok and Bilibili. On February 25, 2025, newly registered accounts were used to search the term \"\" (Kawasaki disease) on TikTok and Bilibili, and the top 100 videos from each platform were collected. Video quality was evaluated using the JAMA benchmark criteria, a modified DISCERN, and PEMAT, while user engagement metrics (likes, comments, saves, and shares) were analyzed for correlations. A total of 146 videos were included. Although TikTok videos demonstrated higher quality and popularity than those on Bilibili, overall video quality on both platforms remained suboptimal. Median JAMA scores were 2.00 and 1.00, modified DISCERN scores were both 3.00, intelligibility was 70% versus 64%, and operability was 67% on both platforms. Most videos were monologue-based and symptom-focused, with pediatricians and individual users as the main uploaders. Pediatricians and individual users were the two largest groups of content creators. Pediatrician-uploaded videos showed higher quality and engagement, whereas individual-user videos were more often misleading and less interactive. Five major misinformation themes were identified, including symptom oversimplification, incorrect etiological claims, promotion of non-evidence-based home treatments, misunderstanding of diagnostic criteria, and misleading statements about immunoglobulin therapy. Video quality was positively correlated with popularity, while longer duration was negatively associated with both quality and engagement. Heterogeneity was observed across platforms. The quality and reliability of Kawasaki disease-related videos on short video platforms remain suboptimal, highlighting the need to address misinformation, refine evaluation tools, and promote high-quality content creation.","21":"The induction of immune tolerance, a state of immunologic hyporesponsiveness to an antigen, is essential to prevent the destructive potential of the immune system in response to harmless or beneficial agents. Early efforts to understand tolerance focused on model stimuli, self-antigens, transplanted organs, and the growing fetus. Through co-evolution, the microbiome and the host immune system have developed strategies that promote immunological tolerance to the microbiome. This dialogue ensures the maintenance of mutualistic interactions that provide a stable habitat for the microbiome which in turn confers numerous physiological benefits to the host. Despite the gut microbiome being a potent inducer of immune tolerance, the mechanisms through which specific members shaped immune function remained largely ignored for decades. The growing appreciation for the immunomodulatory capacity of the microbiome has led to a massive expansion of efforts to define how the balance between tolerance and inflammation is induced and maintained at mucosal sites like the intestine. While the ensuing research uncovered myriad fundamental insights into the concerted host and microbial functions promoting host-microbiome mutualism, inducing tolerance to clinically relevant antigens remains a major challenge in the development of tolerogenic therapies. Here, we trace the interaction between intestinal CD4+ T cells and the microbiome, from antigen uptake through to the development of a polarized collection of CD4+ T cells, whose functions are essential for immunological tolerance, and highlight the knowledge gaps that limit efforts to leverage these interactions for clinical benefit.","22":"Lymph nodes are vital immunological organs, yet nodal surgery-including sentinel lymph node biopsy and completion lymph node dissection-is routinely performed in many solid tumors. Importantly, nodal surgery remains clinically valuable in selected settings, particularly for pathological staging and treatment decision-making, and in some contexts for regional disease control. We address a central paradox in surgical oncology: while lymph node dissection aims to control regional metastasis, emerging immunology suggests that intact tumor-draining regional lymph nodes can support antitumor immunity during immune checkpoint blockade. Although the immunological principles discussed may be relevant across a range of solid tumors, the most direct evidence to date comes from immunotherapy-treated settings-particularly tumor types with established checkpoint inhibitor activity-and from studies of regional, non-metastatic (tumor-draining) lymph nodes; whether these observations extend to immunotherapy-refractory tumors or metastatic nodes remains to be determined. Emerging evidence from preclinical models and correlative human studies suggests that tumor-infiltrating immune responses can be seeded from tumor-draining regional lymph nodes, supported by intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (ectopic lymphoid aggregates within tumors) and tumor-associated high endothelial venules (specialized venules that facilitate lymphocyte entry). With advances in imaging and drug-delivery platforms, even metastatic lymph nodes may also be addressed via non-surgical strategies. We propose the \"Lymph Node Catalyst\" hypothesis as an integrative, testable framework: preserved nodal-vascular circuits act as immunological reservoirs that may enhance responses to immunotherapy. This perspective reframes lymph nodes from solely metastatic waystations to context-dependent immune hubs in the immunotherapy era.","23":"Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2<\/sub>) is an ancient and ubiquitous physiological gas that is produced during aerobic respiration, consumed during photosynthesis and is present in the Earth's atmosphere at steadily increasing levels in modern history. CO<sub>2<\/sub> has often been considered a simple waste product of metabolism and has to date garnered considerably less research activity compared to that of oxygen, the substrate of aerobic respiration. However, recent research has demonstrated important roles of CO<sub>2<\/sub> in immunometabolism, immunology, skeletal and smooth muscle physiology, epithelial cell behaviour, cellular signalling and clinical medicine. Identification of CO<sub>2<\/sub> dependent post-translational modifications using recently developed mass spectrometric approaches has directly linked CO<sub>2<\/sub> to protein function (independent of CO<sub>2<\/sub> -associated changes in pH) strengthening the argument for further research in this area. Notably, there has been a lack of reliable tools to directly monitor CO<sub>2<\/sub> in living systems to date. CarboSenR2 is a new CO<sub>2<\/sub> selective fluorescent molecular sensor which has not been fully evaluated in vitro and has not been specifically applied to study CO<sub>2<\/sub> production in cellula. Here, we demonstrate the utility of CarboSenR2 as an activity-based CO<sub>2<\/sub> sensor in multiple cell systems using flow cytometric and microscopy based approaches. These data demonstrate that CarboSenR2 is sensitive to CO<sub>2<\/sub> concentrations within the physiological and pathophysiological range observed in humans and reveal the intriguing presence of mitochondrial-associated R-Dye microdomains within cells. Thus, these findings highlight the potential of CarboSenR2 to facilitate new investigations into the role and dynamics of CO<sub>2<\/sub> in physiological systems.","24":"Although many chemotherapeutic agents induce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, how NETs affect therapeutic efficacy across different cancer types remains poorly understood. Here, we report that irinotecan-induced NETs exhibit differential cytotoxicity against cancer cells through the proteolytic activity of cathepsin G (CTSG), with colon cancer cells exhibiting high sensitivity while liver cancer cells demonstrating marked resistance. Through bioinformatic analysis and siRNA-mediated knockdown validation, we identified SERPINA3, a serine protease inhibitor, as a key factor in this resistance. Mechanistically, SERPINA3 inhibits CTSG-mediated cleavage of the anti-apoptotic protein 14-3-3\u03b5, thereby protecting cells from NET-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway governs SERPINA3 expression in liver cancer cells, with activated p65 directly binding to its promoter. Targeting SERPINA3 with antisense oligonucleotides successfully sensitized liver cancer cells to irinotecan therapy. These findings elucidate a critical mechanism of chemoresistance in liver cancer and propose targeting SERPINA3 as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance chemotherapy efficacy.","25":"Brincidofovir (BCV) is a novel nucleoside phosphonate analogue with unique dual antiviral and anti-tumor properties. The activity of BCV was evaluated in 44 cell-line models, including T\/NK-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T\/NK-NHL, n\u2009=\u200925) and B-cell lymphoma (BCL, n\u2009=\u200919), and their respective NOD\/SCID mice xenograft models. The potential immunogenic effects were examined in a syngeneic EL4-C57BL\/6 murine lymphoma model. BCV demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity across the majority of cell lines regardless of EBV positivity, with IC50 values within clinically achievable human plasma concentrations (2 \u00b5g\/ml) in 17 of 25 (68.0%) T\/NK-NHL and in 13 of 19 (68.4%) BCL. In vivo treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth in all xenograft models compared to vehicle control. Notably, RNAseq analysis demonstrated BCV downregulated MYC-target pathways in T\/NK-NHL models. BCV evoked S-phase cell cycle arrest, replication stress, DNA damage, and apoptosis while triggering STING pathway-mediated interferon responses, PD-L1 expression, and immunogenic cell death. In the EL4-C57BL\/6 model, BCV in combination with anti-PD1 significantly inhibited tumor growth and triggered an immune reaction characterized by the highest scores for adaptive immune response, cytokines\/chemokines and receptors, cytotoxic cells, dendritic cells, NK CD56dim cells, and neutrophils (NanoString Immunology Panel). Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel role for BCV in lymphoma therapy and suggest potential for combination with checkpoint immunotherapy.","26":"No abstract available","27":"Thunderstorm asthma (TA) refers to a phenomenon characterized by sudden onset, large-scale outbreaks, and potentially fatal acute exacerbations of asthma. Despite accumulating epidemiological evidence, its cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies have proposed a core framework involving \"environmental triggers-epithelial barrier damage-immune dysregulation.\" During thunderstorms, high humidity and strong convection can cause pollen to hydrate and rupture into sub-pollen particles (SPPs) smaller than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm, which may further combine with other pollutants such as\u00a0particulate matter\u2009\u2264\u20092.5\u00a0\u03bcm(PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3<\/sub>) to form bioaerosols capable of penetrating small airways. These factors can lead to damage of the airway epithelial barrier, with sequential cellular and molecular pathophysiological changes including downregulation of various tight junction proteins in the epithelial barrier, imbalance of mucociliary clearance function, and upregulated secretion of epithelial alarmins such as interleukin (IL)-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). This results in increased disease severity through activation of innate and adaptive immunity (e.g., type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2)\/T helper 2(Th2) axis activation leading to immunoglobulin E(IgE) upregulation, eosinophil activation, and mast cell degranulation; Th17-mediated neutrophilic inflammation; and toll-like receptor(TLR)-mediated innate immune processes and mucosal inflammation) and enhancement of intrinsic susceptibility factors (e.g., TLR gene polymorphisms and abnormal expression, DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as microbiome-host interactions). According to research in meteorology, exposomics, and molecular immunology, we believe that airway epithelial barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation play significant roles in TA. Future translational directions primarily involve establishing a population stratification and early warning system through combinations of meteorological factors with allergens\/pollutants, thereby enhancing public protection and health management efforts to improve the early warning, prevention, and clinical management of TA.","28":"Sepsis-related immune dysregulation occurs in three overlapping phases, including pathogen recognition, inflammation, and immune paralysis. There are many immune cells that underlie these three phases, with the most well-studied being epithelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and T cells. These cells regulate multiple downstream mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, that can be measured and used as immunologic biomarkers. Past failures in sepsis immune-modulating treatment trials have likely resulted from the inclusion of patients meeting sepsis clinical criteria but who do not sufficiently express the immunologic target under investigation. More precise approaches to trial designs may uncover effective immune-modulating therapies.","29":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in neonates (MIS-N) is a rare condition linked to perinatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We report a case of a term male neonate presenting at birth with severe respiratory failure and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Initial evaluations, including chest X-ray and ECG, were unremarkable, but echocardiography showed elevated pulmonary pressures without structural abnormalities. Over the next few days, the infant developed diffuse skin peeling, acute kidney injury and hypertension, creating a perplexing clinical picture. Only after retrospective maternal history revealed a late-pregnancy febrile illness was SARS-CoV-2 testing performed: the mother was RT-PCR positive, and the neonate had markedly elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG with negative RT-PCR, consistent with proposed diagnostic criteria for MIS-N. The infant responded well to methylprednisolone (2\u2009mg\/kg\/day) and intravenous immunoglobulin (2\u2009g\/kg). Serial echocardiography revealed diffuse endomyocardial and coronary intimal echogenicity suggestive of calcification, reproducible across time and imaging platforms, a feature not previously described in MIS-N. Persistent systemic hypertension was attributed to MIS-N after exclusion of other causes. The infant was discharged on aspirin (3\u2009mg\/kg\/day) and antihypertensives and remains well on follow-up. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of MIS-N and highlights unusual sequelae such as myocardial calcification and neonatal hypertension.","30":"Approximately 6%-10% of adults carry food allergy labels. Many such labels are unverified and may be incorrect, contributing to delays in appropriate care, significant dietary restriction, anxiety and unnecessary use of emergency medications. Oral food challenges (OFCs) are the gold standard for confirming or excluding food allergy, but the current model of clinic-based challenges often has long wait times and logistical barriers. This study aims to investigate the feasibility and safety of home-based OFCs compared with standard in-clinic challenges in adults with negative skin-prick testing. <b>Food C<\/b>hallenge at <b>HO<\/b>me or in <b>M<\/b>edical <b>P<\/b>ractice is a pilot multicentre randomised controlled trial enrolling 120 adults with reported food allergy labels and negative skin prick testing to the implicated food. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to undergo an OFC either at home or in-clinic. The study is designed to generate feasibility and preliminary safety data for home-based OFC, measured by the proportion of participants experiencing immune-mediated adverse events (AEs), compared with clinic-based OFC. Feasibility metrics (screening to recruitment ratio, protocol completion), non-immune AEs, protocol adherence and quality of life assessed using the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-12 at baseline prior to OFC and 6\u2009months post OFC will also be collected. Statistical analysis will include descriptive statistics, with comparisons between arms using risk differences and relative risks with 95% CIs. The trial has received ethics approval from the Austin Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC\/111750\/Austin-2024). Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and scientific meetings. Data will be presented in aggregated, de-identified form. NCT06916819.","31":"This study aimed to investigate the self-management experiences of individuals living with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through the lens of the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation-Behaviour model to inform the design of personalised self-management interventions. A phenomenological method, common in qualitative research, was used. Data were collected using semistructured in-depth interviews. Data collection and analysis were conducted concurrently, guided by the principle of reaching data saturation. The data were evaluated using thematic analysis. The study was conducted in a quiet, private setting, either a classroom or consultation room, free from external disturbances. Between March and September 2023, 15 individuals diagnosed with SLE who met the inclusion criteria participated in the in-depth interviews. A total of 15 patients were interviewed, and 3 themes and 9 subthemes regarding self-management experiences were extracted: (1) Capability level: Deficiency in disease knowledge and insufficient self-management skills; (2) Motivation level: Lack of self-management awareness, perceived benefits and risks, uncertainty about disease progression and appearance-related anxiety; (3) Opportunity level: Family understanding and support, social support and environmental facilitation. SLE patients' self-management behaviours are influenced by both personal experiences and external environments. Healthcare professionals should enhance health education, deliver individualised guidance, strengthen patients' self-management awareness and psychological positivity, optimise medical resource allocation, and bolster social support to improve patients'self-management capabilities.","32":"Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a rapidly expanding form of environmental pollution that disrupts natural light-dark cycles and alters behavioral and physiological rhythms across species. Because immune function is tightly linked to environmental cues, studying ALAN within an ecoimmunological framework is essential for understanding its real-world impacts on wildlife fitness. In natural settings, immune rhythms are shaped by multiple, interacting environmental pressures, and evaluating ALAN against this broader ecological backdrop is critical for interpreting its physiological consequences. We investigated how low-intensity ALAN affects immune and endocrine rhythmicity, antibody responses, and survival in two wild rodent species with opposing activity patterns, the nocturnal Acomys dimidiatus and the diurnal Acomys russatus, maintained in semi-natural outdoor enclosures. Under natural light-dark conditions, both species exhibited daily oscillations in circulating lymphocyte frequencies, and in A. dimidiatus, fecal cortisol also showed a clear daily rhythm. These rhythms were disrupted or dampened under ALAN. Moreover, antibody titers were significantly higher when immunization occurred during the species-specific rest phase, but ALAN exposure disrupted these rhythms, eliminating time-of-day variation in antibody responses. Overall, ALAN increased the mortality risk by 2.35-fold. Although controlled laboratory experiments have been essential for advancing immunology, they offer limited insight into how environmental disturbances like light pollution affect wildlife under realistic conditions. By studying wild rodents in semi-natural habitats, we reveal that ALAN exposure alters immune rhythms, endocrine patterns, and survival in ways that emerge only when animals experience natural ecological variation. These results highlight that immune baselines in the wild are products of complex environmental interactions and that ALAN can disrupt these integrated physiological systems. Together, these findings underscore the need for ecoimmunological approaches to assess how expanding light pollution threatens wildlife health and resilience. Significance Statement Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a growing anthropogenic disturbance with wide-ranging ecological and physiological impacts. While its disruptive effect on circadian rhythms is well documented, its effects on immune function remain underexplored. Our findings show that ALAN alters immune rhythmicity and weakens time-dependent antibody responses in wild rodents under semi-natural conditions, potentially increasing susceptibility to infection. Studying the effects of light pollution on wild species under natural conditions is essential not only for understanding its impact on ecosystem health, but also for assessing how altered immune function may influence the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases. These insights underscore the need to investigate immunity in ecologically relevant contexts beyond traditional laboratory models and conditions.","33":"Dry eye disease (DED) is classified based on its predominant etiology into aqueous tear-deficient (ATD), evaporative, or mixed. Sj\u04e7gren disease keratoconjunctivitis sicca (SjD-KCS) is a very severe autoimmune form of ATD DED. The purpose of this work was to compare transcriptomic changes in the conjunctiva sampled from patients with ATD, SjD-KCS, and healthy controls (HC) to evaluate distinctions in the immune response on the ocular surface based on diagnosis. Impression cytology of the temporal bulbar conjunctiva was collected using the EyePrim device. RNA was extracted and submitted with the Nanostring nCounter Human Immunology V2 panel for gene expression analysis. Results were uploaded to ROSALIND and Metascape to identify DEGs by comparison (all DED vs HC; SjD vs HC; ATD vs HC) and associated predicted pathways. A subset of samples (n\u00a0=\u00a04 per group) were used for immunofluorescent staining of LAMP3 and HLA-DR. 49 patients were enrolled in the study (25 HC; 12 SjD; 12 ATD). 100 DEGs were found in the comparison of all DED vs HC. 69 DEGs were found in the SjD vs HC. 11 DEGs were found in the ATD vs HC. There were no DEGs identified in the SjD vs ATD comparison. DEGs were involved in immune pathways related to viral response, adaptive immunity, and cell to cell communication. DED conjunctiva had increased expression of LAMP3 and HLA-DR compared to HC. Our findings demonstrate that DED, regardless of the diagnosis, have similar immune-related DEGs and associated pathways on the ocular surface.","34":"Cancer immunotherapies trigger highly variable responses in patients and in genetically identical mouse models. To assess the intrinsic stochasticity of these therapies, we performed thousands of well-controlled ex vivo immunoassays. We show that leukocyte responses and tumor cytotoxicity are highly variable at the macroscopic level and statistically distributed as a shifted Poisson process. Stochastic activation of a rare subpopulation of T cells (so-called Spark T cells), coupled with a paracrine interferon (IFN)-\u03b3-driven positive feedback, accounts for this measured \"noise\" in immunotherapeutic reactions. We integrated these quantitative insights into a custom-designed machine-learning pipeline to analyze immune reactions with single-cell resolution. This led us to phenotypically and functionally identify Spark T cells in murine naive T cells and in human T cell blasts as prepared for adoptive T cell therapy. We then demonstrate their relevance in explaining variable outcomes in cancer immunotherapies.","35":"The serous cavities are fluid-filled spaces that surround the lung, heart, and abdomen. One of their main functions is to provide protection and lubrication for their encapsulated organs. In addition to these physiological roles, the serous cavities are rich immune cell reservoirs. Although these cavity-derived immune cells have been studied ex vivo for many years, the past decade has led to substantial advances in serous cavity biology. Importantly, immune mechanisms that occur in these fluid environments and communication networks between these cavities and the tissues that they contain have been elucidated. In this Review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge of cellular and molecular interactions that govern immunology across all serous cavities, comparing animal models and human studies. A deeper understanding of how the serous cavities provide immune protection to the tissues that they encompass is likely to reveal therapeutic avenues for manipulation of these cavities to improve disease outcomes.","36":"Despite the crucial roles of GATA-3 in lymphocyte biology, little is known about its intracellular distribution and the mechanisms regulating its nuclear import. Single-cell analyses on confocal microscopy images revealed that GATA-3 was enriched in the nucleus of naive and T helper (Th)2 cells, whereas Th1 cells preferentially accumulated it in the cytoplasm. This GATA-3 compartmentalization was mirrored in innate lymphoid cells ex vivo. In vitro or in vivo reprogramming of Th1 and Th2 cells reversed the subset-specific GATA-3 localization and triggered the acquisition or loss of GATA-3-dependent effector functions, respectively. We identified importin-\u03b2 as the transporter mediating GATA-3's nuclear import. In Th2 cells, the subtle cytoplasmic accumulation of GATA-3 following importin-\u03b2 blockade disrupted the GATA-3 autoactivation loop and impeded type 2 cell features. This sensitivity was explained by the prompt nuclear degradation of GATA-3, thus emphasizing that Th2 cell function depends on continuous and maximal nuclear import of GATA-3. Our results highlight the control of GATA-3 import into the nucleus as a fundamental rheostat of lymphocyte biology.","37":"During World War II, Polish physicians Eugeniusz \u0141azowski and Stanis\u0142aw Matulewicz fabricated a typhus epidemic, which they reported in detail only after the war. They injected inactivated Proteus bacteria to patients suffering from mild, flu-like ailments in order to trigger a positive Weil-Felix reaction in their serum, the standard diagnostic tool for typhus at that time. These falsely labelled typhus patients would then be protected from seizure by German occupiers, who were much concerned about transmission of this highly deadly disease. According to \u0141azowski and Matulewicz, this action saved many Poles from forced labour and other atrocities. We here show that this false epidemic was possible with the simple means available at that time, and that it is plausible from a medical and a historical perspective. How the two doctors combined medical textbook knowledge, social responsibility, epidemiological know-how and ingenuity under war conditions is outstanding. They should serve as role models for humanity and resistance under oppressive systems for present and future generations of physicians.","38":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects nearly every individual whereupon it persists for life under the control of a broad immune response. EBV provides a valuable system for understanding human T cell immunology. It is genetically stable and expresses well-characterised viral proteins, many of which have been mapped for HLA-I- and HLA-II- restricted epitopes allowing the cognate CD8+ and CD4+ T cell response to be measured and characterised. Individuals with symptomatic infectious mononucleosis readily allow primary infection to be studied in both blood and tissues. Here, we describe the T cell response to primary EBV infection in children and adolescents, and to persistent EBV infection over the life course. We also examine the EBV-specific T cell response in multiple sclerosis, now recognised to be strongly associated with EBV and in which certain HLA alleles influence disease risk. Finally, we explore unconventional T cells, including HLA-E-restricted\u00a0T cells, gamma delta\u00a0T cells, and NKT cells in the context of EBV infection.","39":"Accumulated studies have reported that hematopoietic differentiation was primarily regulated by transcription factors. Early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) is an essential transcription factor for B lymphopoiesis. Contrary to the canonical notion, we found that a single miRNA, miRNA-195 (<i>Mir195<\/i>) transduction let <i>Ebf1<\/i>-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) express CD19, carry out V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination, which implied that B cell matured without EBF1. A part of the mechanism was caused by FOXO1 accumulation via inhibition of FOXO1 phosphorylation pathways in which targets of <i>Mir195<\/i> are enriched. These results suggested that some miRNA transductions could function as alternatives to transcription factors.","40":"The lingual surface is composed of a tough epithelium that affords effective protection from the resident and food-borne microbiota. The circumvallate taste papillae (CVP) in the back of the tongue are associated with underlying minor salivary glands called von Ebner's gland (VEG) that drains its secretions into the trenches of the papillae. The taste buds are exposed to the lingual surface through taste pores, to enable interaction with tastants. These openings may be exploited by pathogens for infection. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) such as those in the gut epithelium, tonsils and lachrymal and salivary ducts possess specialized cells called microfold (M) cells that transport luminal microbes and present them to underlying immune cells, which then initiate an appropriate immune response. Our previous work indicated that type II taste cells might mediate similar immune surveillance akin to M cells and that CVP is patrolled by large population of immune cells. Using single cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) of CVP, we discovered that the duct cells of the VEG strongly express markers for M cells. The ducts were capable of transcytosing fluorescently labelled E. coli and fluorescent nanobeads, which are then taken up by underlying immune cells. We propose that taste and duct cell-mediated immune surveillance might be crucial for preventing infection of taste papillae and for maintaining taste function, and conversely, this pathway might be hijacked by microbes for infection.","41":"Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory cutaneous disorder predominantly affecting the centrofacial region, whose pathogenesis is complex and not yet fully understood. In this review we summarized the latest significant advances in the pathogenesis of rosacea in recent years. In genomic studies, the application of bioinformatics techniques such as whole-genome sequencing has identified novel susceptibility genes and linked multiple pathogenic mechanisms. Neurovascular dysfunction resulting from abnormal neuropeptides expression and dysregulated amino acid metabolism constitutes an important pathogenic factor in rosacea. The TLR2\/LL-37\/mTORC1 signaling axis, as a core regulatory pathway in innate immunity has been elucidated in detail. In addition, the dysbiosis of skin and gut microbiota, together with the impairment of skin barrier function, is also closely associated with the onset and progression of this disease. The deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of rosacea will benefit the development of new drugs and promote individualized diagnosis and treatment.","42":"Medication-overuse headache (MOH) develops when drugs intended for acute pain relief lower the threshold for headache chronification. The biological mechanisms driving this transition remain poorly understood. We aim to synthesize current evidence on immune and epigenetic alterations in MOH, identifying new targets of interest and outlining priorities for future research and precision-based interventions. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus from inception to May 2025 for original human or animal studies reporting immune and\/or epigenetic measures in MOH. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed with the SYRCLE tool for animal studies and JBI tools for human studies. Findings were narratively synthesized, and a domain-based strength-of-evidence (SoE) framework was applied. Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria. Animal studies identified two immunological pathways involved in MOH resolution: low-dose interleukin-2-mediated expansion of regulatory T cells and inhibition of the P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7R)\/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. Clinical studies reported systemic low-grade inflammation in MOH patients, including elevated leukocyte counts, interleukin-6 and gut-derived inflammatory markers. Two epigenetic studies identified differential DNA methylation in genes regulating immune responses and pain transmission. Most studies were small and cross-sectional with limited adjustment. Overall SoE was low-moderate across domains. Current evidence points to plausible immune and epigenetic involvement in MOH but is insufficient for causal inference or clinical guidance. Findings are hypothesis-generating and most useful for translational prioritization.","43":"Ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors (IBATi) are a new, attractive therapeutic mechanism to alter the enterohepatic circulation through depletion of the bile acid pool by blocking bile acid reuptake in the ileum leading to improvements in pruritus and liver function in cholestatic liver diseases. These drugs may also have an impact on immunity, the gut microbiome, and motility. IBATi are approved in Japan for the treatment of idiopathic chronic constipation. There are two IBATi, maralixibat and odevixibat, that have been extensively investigated in clinical trials and are FDA approved for cholestatic pruritus in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis and Alagille syndrome. Clinical trials exploring IBATi in other cholestatic conditions, such as biliary atresia, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis, are currently ongoing. In this review, we will outline the emerging data regarding the physiology and mechanism of action for the IBATi class, an overview of clinical trials that led to the approval of maralixibat and odevixibat, ongoing clinical trials in adult cholestatic liver diseases, and the future of this drug class in systemic apical sodium bile acid transporter inhibitors.","44":"Immune homeostasis is indispensable for preserving organismal integrity, orchestrated through complex molecular networks encompassing immune cell dynamics, microbial cues, and epigenetic regulation. Among these, the gut microbiota-non-coding RNA (ncRNA) axis has recently garnered substantial attention as a multifaceted modulator of host immunity. Emerging evidence indicates that microbial-derived metabolites can reprogram ncRNA expression, thereby modulating immune cell differentiation, activation, and effector responses. Notably, dysregulation of this axis has been mechanistically implicated in the etiology of diverse immune-related pathologies, including colorectal cancer, sepsis, atherosclerosis, and neuroimmune conditions. Particularly intriguing is its translational potential: both microbial signatures and ncRNA profiles are being leveraged as diagnostic biomarkers and actionable targets for immune modulation. In this review, we delineate the molecular frameworks underpinning the gut microbiota-ncRNA-immune and explore how its perturbation contributes to pathogenesis. We further highlight emerging therapeutic strategies targeting this axis, underscoring its significance in precision immunology and host-microbiota co-regulation.","45":"No abstract available","46":"We compared duodenal biopsies showing active celiac disease (CeD) to normal controls using single-cell RNA sequencing, cyclic immunofluorescence, RNAScope, and proximity ligation assays. There is increased infiltration of villous but not crypt epithelium T cells bearing either \u03b1\u03b2 or \u03b3\u03b4 T cell receptors (TCRs) in CeD. Both T cell subsets are activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and are the predominant mucosal source of IFN\u03b3. In response to this IFN\u03b3, villous but not crypt enterocytes show an IFN\u03b3 signature, including nuclear phospho-STAT1 protein, class II HLA molecules and IFN\u03b3-inducible chemokines known to recruit CTLs (e.g., CCL3, CCL4, CXCL10, and CXCL11) and receptors for these chemokines are expressed on the infiltrating CTLs. Villous enterocytes also display increased HLA-E and HLA-B mRNAs and proteins. Bioinformatic analyses (NICHES) and proximity ligation assays show frequent binding of both \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 TCRs with enterocyte <i>HLA-E<\/i> or <i>HLA-B<\/i>, but not <i>HLA-DR<\/i>. In contrast, NKG2C, proposed as an alternative trigger of CTL activation, is infrequently expressed and shows few interactions with HLA-E. Our data suggest that activated intraepithelial CTLs produce IFN\u03b3 which recruits additional CTLs and increases antigen-dependent killing of villous epithelium using either conventional or HLA-E antigen presentation.","47":"The protective correlates of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<\/i> (<i>Mtb<\/i>) infection-elicited host immune responses are incompletely understood. Here, we report pro-pathogenic crosstalk involving Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup> granulocytes (Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup>Gra), IL-17, and COX2. We show that in the lungs of <i>Mtb<\/i>-infected wild-type mice, either BCG-vaccinated or not, most intracellular bacilli are Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup>Gra-resident 4 weeks post-infection onwards. In the genetically susceptible <i>ifng<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice, excessive Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup>Gra infiltration correlates with severe bacteremia. Neutralizing IL-17 (anti-IL17mAb) and COX2 inhibition by celecoxib reverse Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup>Gra infiltration, associated pathology, and death in <i>ifng<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice. Surprisingly, Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup>Gra also serves as the major source of IL-17 in the lungs of <i>Mtb<\/i>-infected WT or <i>ifng<sup>-\/-<\/sup><\/i> mice. The IL-17-COX2-Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup>Gra interplay also operates in WT mice. Inhibiting ROR\u03b3t, the key transcription factor for IL-17 production or COX2, reduces the bacterial burden in Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup>Gra, leading to reduced bacterial burden and pathology in the lungs of WT mice. In the <i>Mtb<\/i>-infected WT mice, COX2 inhibition abrogates IL-17 levels in the lung homogenates and significantly enhances BCG's protective efficacy, mainly by targeting the Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup>Gra-resident <i>Mtb<\/i> pool, a phenotype also observed when IL-17 is blocked by ROR\u03b3t inhibitor. Furthermore, in pulmonary TB patients, high neutrophil count and IL-17 correlated with adverse treatment outcomes. Together, our results suggest that IL-17 and PGE2 are the negative correlates of protection, and we propose targeting the pro-pathogenic IL-17-COX2-Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup>Gra axis for TB prevention and therapy.","48":"Infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, is endemic to the Americas and can irreparably damage the cardiac and gastrointestinal systems during decades of parasite persistence. Diagnosis of chronic infection requires confirmation by multiple serological assays due to the imperfect performance of existing tests. Current serology tests were developed using small specimen sets predominantly from South America, and lower performance has been observed in patients who acquired infection in Central America and Mexico. To improve Chagas disease serology, we evaluated antibody responses against the entire T. cruzi proteome with phage display immunoprecipitation sequencing and further evaluated high prevalence antigens by immunoassay. We utilized specimen sets representing Mexico, Central America and South America and varying cardiac disease presentations, from 185 cases and 143 controls. We identified over 1,300 antigenic T. cruzi peptides. A trans-sialidase antigen demonstrated high seroprevalence across all regions and has not previously been described as a diagnostic target. Orthogonal validation of this peptide demonstrated increased antibody reactivity for infections originating from Central America. This study provides proteome-wide identification of seroreactive T. cruzi peptides across a range of endemic populations not previously represented in antigen discovery and identifies a trans-sialidase peptide antigen (TS23) with potential for translation into diagnostic serological assays. Not Applicable.","49":"Taxonomic classification alone fails to capture the ecological and functional diversity of vaginal microbiomes, particularly those dominated by <i>Gardnerella<\/i> species. Using the expanded VIRGO2 gene catalog, we developed the vaginal inference of subspecies and typing algorithm (VISTA), a novel ortholog-based framework that defined metagenomic subspecies and 25 metagenomic community state types (mgCSTs), including six distinct <i>Gardnerella<\/i>-dominated profiles. The mgCSTs exhibit marked differences in species composition, functional gene content, transcriptional activity, and host immune responses. These findings reveal that <i>Gardnerella<\/i> predominance does not uniformly equate to dysbiosis and underscore the importance of functional context in shaping host-microbiome interactions. VISTA provides scalable classifiers and an interactive application to support mechanistic studies of vaginal microbiome function and its implications for reproductive health.IMPORTANCEThe vaginal microbiome plays a central role in reproductive and gynecologic health, yet its functional diversity and ecological organization remain poorly understood. Traditional 16S rRNA approaches provide only a partial view of this complexity, overlooking the strain-level variation that often determines microbial behavior and host outcomes. By applying metagenomic sequencing and scalable computational modeling, we developed the vaginal inference of subspecies and typing algorithm, a framework that defines gene-based subspecies and community state types across diverse populations. These classifications reveal new insights into the genomic and ecological foundations of vaginal community structure and offer a standardized resource for comparative and translational microbiome research. This work establishes the foundation for functionally informed diagnostics and precision interventions targeting women's reproductive health.","50":"No abstract available","51":"The rising global cancer burden underscores the urgent need for innovative and effective therapies. Molecular and cellular immunology advances have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, transforming laboratory discoveries into clinical breakthroughs. The Second Bone Marrow Transplant and Cellular Therapy Congress, held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), on October 26<sup>th<\/sup> - 27<sup>th<\/sup>, 2024, and sponsored by the Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center (ADSCC), convened global experts to discuss cutting-edge developments in adoptive cell transfer (ACT); chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) engineering and T-cell receptor (TCR) innovations. Discussions covered key challenges such as tumor microenvironment (TME) resistance, antigen escape, manufacturing complexity, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. Experts emphasized the crucial role of biomarker identification in optimizing patient selection and improving treatment efficacy. Additionally, emerging strategies were highlighted to enhance the durability and specificity of cellular therapies, including next-generation CAR-T designs, combination approaches, and novel gene-editing technologies. With over 2,300 participants from academia, research, and healthcare, the event fostered international collaborations and knowledge exchange. The ADSCC continues to play a pivotal role in integrating advanced cellular therapies into healthcare systems, contributing to the expansion of precision oncology in the UAE and beyond. This review analyzes the latest advances in immunotherapy, highlighting their clinical impact, challenges, and future directions in the evolving landscape of cancer treatment, as debated during the congress.","52":"Peptide-based vaccines, utilizing defined B- and T-cell epitopes, have emerged over the past two decades as promising alternatives to conventional vaccine platforms. Their key advantages, including excellent safety profiles, precise immunological targeting, and ease of manufacture, position them as a versatile tool in modern immunology. However, the widespread clinical application of these vaccines is significantly challenged by inherent limitations, most notably their low inherent immunogenicity and susceptibility to enzymatic degradation in vivo, leading to structural instability and short half-lives. This review systematically examines the innovative strategies being developed to overcome these critical obstacles. It delves into advances in rational vaccine design, highlighting the pivotal role of bioinformatics and computational tools for precise epitope selection and the engineering of sophisticated multi-epitope constructs that elicit broader immune responses. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of novel drug delivery systems, such as a diverse range of nanoparticle carriers (e.g., liposomes, polymer-based), and review the mechanism of action of next-generation adjuvants. These technologies are crucial for enhancing antigen presentation, protecting the peptide payload, and promoting robust, durable cellular and humoral immunity. By synthesizing current literature from databases like PubMed and Google Scholar, this review offers a detailed overview of recent progress in peptide vaccine development against viral pathogens, drawing on key findings from both preclinical and clinical studies. It highlights key findings from preclinical and clinical studies and provides insights into the mechanistic actions and future potential of these precision vaccines in combating evolving viral threats.","53":"This article presents an overview of current research on determining target blood levels of vitamin D. It examines the biochemical and metabolic properties of vitamin D, as well as the challenges of standardizing 25(OH)D measurements and the variability of threshold values across populations. It discusses ambiguities in scientific data and the need to consider individual factors when interpreting vitamin D levels. This review is unique in its comprehensive approach to analyzing the effects of vitamin D not only on bone health but also on immune and metabolic functions, which broadens ever evolving understanding of the clinical significance of vitamin D. This work emphasizes the importance of personalized recommendations for vitamin D dosing and prescription based on current clinical data and scientific standards. Performed analysis highlights the need for personalized vitamin D supplementation to reach and maintain blood levels between 30 and 60 ng\/mL, noting that higher levels might be necessary for people with genetic or acquired resistance. These insights substantiate the development of evidence-based, personalized clinical strategies for the prevention and treatment of vitamin D deficiency-related disorders. The synthesized data offer significant implications for advancing research and clinical practice in endocrinology, obstetrics, dermatology, neurology and immunology.","54":"No abstract available","55":"No abstract available","56":"No abstract available","57":"To overcome the systemic toxicity and poor tumor targeting of the TLR7\/8 agonist R848, this study developed a derivative by attaching a phenylboronic acid (PBA) group to R848. The resultant R848-PBA retain the immune activation of R848, easily assembly with indocyanine green (ICG) into nanoparticles (R-P@ICG NPs), which demonstrated greatly improved safety and excellent tumor targetability. Inspired by this, paclitaxel (PTX) was also conjugated with PBA and self-assembly with chlorogenic acid (CA) into nanoparticles (P-P@CA NPs). In 4T1 tumor mice mode, P-P@CA NPs induced significant immunogenic cell death (ICD) to release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) while R-P@ICG NPs synergistically promoted dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and trigger both innate and adaptive immune responses. This combined therapy achieved a tumor inhibition rate of 93.2\u202f% and a tumor eradication rate of 33.3\u202f%, accompanied by a long-lasting anti-tumor immune memory and no evident toxic effect. Phenylboronic acid modification and self-assembly with small molecules presents a promising strategy to realize the clinical translation of the synergistic antitumor efficacy of R848-based chemoimmunotherapy and chemotherapeutics by alleviated systemic toxicity and endowed tumor targetability.","58":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has renewed interest in the relationship between immunity and cognition. Despite decades of work, the impact of viral exposure, mainly in the field of HIV, herpes and hepatitis infections, on distinct cognitive processes remains unclear, as most studies use global screening tools (e.g., MoCA) in isolation in each infectious context. This systematic narrative review adopts a transnosological approach, summarizing previously reported immune-cognition relationships across viral infections. Of 931 studies, 32 met inclusion criteria (N=25,325) spanning SARS-CoV-2, HIV, herpes, hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus, and multiple infections. Reported studies on immuno-cognitive relationships reveal several consistent findings. Elevated circulating CD14<sup>+<\/sup>CD16<sup>+<\/sup> intermediate monocytes correlated with slower processing speed, reduced episodic memory and mental flexibility. Higher CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells were associated with better processing efficiency, while reduced T cells and B cells levels together with elevated IgG predicted deficits in memory and attention. Most proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3) were associated with impairments in overlapping cognitive domains (e.g., memory), whereas IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, consistently supported executive and memory performance.","59":"The Hedgehog pathway may be involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Its inhibitor, Vismodegib, has therapeutic potential, but the underlying mechanisms require further investigation. A COPD mouse model was established using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cigarette smoke exposure, with concurrent Vismodegib intervention. Assessments included histopathology, pulmonary function, inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) markers, macrophage polarization, and integrated transcriptomic and gut microbiota (16S rRNA) analysis. The results show that Vismodegib alleviated lung injury and fibrosis, regulated the respiratory rate, reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 (IL-6), IL-1\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), promoted a phenotypic shift from M1 to M2 macrophage polarization, and suppressed NETs formation, as demonstrated by decreased levels of neutrophil elastase (NE), citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and Cit-H3<sup>+<\/sup>Ly6G<sup>+<\/sup> cells. Multi-omics analysis revealed enrichment of the IL-17 signaling pathway and increased gut microbial abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Tannerellaceae. Vismodegib may alleviate inflammation and tissue damage in COPD by inhibiting NETs-mediated M1 polarization of macrophages. This study is the first to propose the targeting of NET-driven macrophage polarization via Hedgehog inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for COPD, providing a new mechanistic framework for drug repurposing.","60":"Copper (Cu) is essential for innate immunity; however, how neutrophils regulate Cu homeostasis to support their functions remains unclear. We found that myeloid progenitors express abundant Cu-transporter ATP7B targeted to distinct vesicles and store Cu in vesicles. During neutrophil differentiation, ATP7B is downregulated, whereas ATP7A, LOXL2, and SLC31A2 are induced, suggesting a coordinated switch from Cu storage to utilization. As mature neutrophils exit the bone marrow, cellular Cu levels drop markedly, indicating Cu release during late maturation or egress. Myeloid-specific deletion of Atp7b in mice uncouples lineage commitment from functional maturation: Atp7b-deficient cells differentiate into neutrophils but fail to mature fully, showing more mitochondria, fewer lysosome-like structures, lower abundance of Cebp-\u03b5 and Ngal, reduced tubulin levels, and disrupted microtubules. Following lipopolysaccharide injection, Atp7b-deficient bone marrow releases fewer neutrophils into the bloodstream. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of the Cu-transport network in neutrophil maturation and egress.","61":"The incorporation of organoids with immune cells in co-culture systems signifies a groundbreaking advancement in the fields of cancer research and immunology. These three-dimensional models, derived from primary tumor specimens or stem cells, provide a more accurate representation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) than conventional two-dimensional cultures or animal models. This enhanced model allows for a thorough examination of the intricate interactions between cancer cells and the immune system. Although the success rates for organoid initiation can vary, averaging 36.8% across 13 different tumor types, successful organoid establishment enables the co-culture with a variety of immune cells, such as T cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. This platform enables the study of immune responses to cancer, mechanisms of immune evasion, and the influence of the TME on immune activation and suppression. The review emphasizes research involving intestinal, pancreatic, brain, liver, and cervical organoids, highlighting their role in elucidating disease mechanisms, assessing the effectiveness of immunotherapies (including checkpoint inhibitors and therapeutic vaccines), and conducting preclinical drug evaluations. Notable examples include modeling graft-versus-host disease with intestinal organoids, investigating the influence of DCLK1 on immunosuppression in pancreatic cancer, evaluating the effectiveness of engineered T cells against neuroblastoma using brain organoids, and analyzing the effects of cancer-associated fibroblasts on drug responses in colon cancer. Additionally, the potential of organoids in vaccine development and testing, particularly for influenza and other viral infections, is examined, demonstrating their utility in assessing immune responses and vaccine effectiveness. Despite existing challenges, such as the relatively low efficiency of organoid generation and the complexities involved in fully mimicking the TME, ongoing technological innovations, including tumor-on-chip systems and enhanced matrix materials, are expected to improve the functionality and clinical applicability of these advanced in vitro models.","62":"To determine the aetiological, clinical, and therapeutic features of children diagnosed with uveitis in a tertiary referral centre in Northern Italy. Evaluation of medical data of all new paediatric (\u2264\u200916\u00a0years old) referrals to the Ocular Immunology Unit of Reggio Emilia (Northern Italy) between November 2015 and December 2023. An interdisciplinary diagnostic-therapeutic pathway-based approach was adopted for all patients. Among a pool of 263 patients, the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.32. Anterior uveitis was the most common diagnosis (45.2%), followed by pan-(23.6%), intermediate (16.7%), and posterior (14.5%) uveitis. The most identifiable specific diagnoses were juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (27.8%), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (8.7%), and toxoplasmosis (6.8%). Non-infectious systemic disease aetiologies were the most frequent (47.5%), followed by infectious uveitis (15.2%) and non-infectious ocular-specific conditions (2.7%). Idiopathic uveitis accounted for 34.6% of cases. Immunosuppressants were administered in 58.5% of patients. Antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors, and biologics were prescribed in 52.5%, 4.6% and 31.6% of cases, respectively. Methotrexate, adalimumab, and azathioprine were the most commonly prescribed immunosuppressants (29.3%, 26.6%, and 21.7% of patients, respectively). JIA-associated uveitis is the type most associated with surgical procedures (39.7%). The patterns of uveitis in children differ from those in adults, with infectious aetiologies being less common and idiopathic uveitis accounting for the majority of cases. However, the frequency of idiopathic uveitis in Italy is decreasing. Nowadays, a wide range of immunosuppressants are used for the treatment of paediatric uveitis.","63":"Owing to their immunoprotective properties, natural killer (NK) cells are critical for the innate immune response to pathogens, as well as a new wave of cancer immunotherapy that harnesses natural cytotoxicity. We sought to study the genetic and epigenetic drivers behind human-specific NK cell receptors, so that we can better understand the underlying cellular function. Here, we present a transcriptomic, proteomic (CITE-seq), and chromatin (single nuclei ATAC-seq) profiling of human peripheral NK cell subsets, which was then compared with genomic databases. Through integrative multi-omics, we demonstrate that CD56<sup>bright<\/sup> versus CD56<sup>dim<\/sup> NK cell subsets have differential distal regulatory element (DRE) landscapes, with fewer accessible DREs in the CD56<sup>dim<\/sup> NK cells. We combine our epigenetic data, deposited Hi-C, and human genetic data to show mechanisms governing the NCAM1 (encoding CD56) and the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) loci. We identify an NCAM1 DRE that binds STAT3 in most NK cells, while identifying a genetic cohort that has motifs for binding repressive BLIMP1 at the DRE and resulting in less CD56 expression. Together, our findings reveal novel epigenetic and transcriptomic systems for the regulation of NK cell receptors driving NK cell cytotoxicity and diversity.","64":"Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) joins skin, muscle, bone, nerve, and vessels into a single graft that is both highly immunogenic and mechanically complex. Biopolymers, natural or synthetic, can provide structural scaffolding, localized drug release, and immune modulation. Although widely explored in solid-organ transplantation, their utility in VCA is poorly defined. We therefore conducted a systematic review to consolidate current evidence and map translational priorities. Adhering to PRISMA 2020 and registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251039845), we searched PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar through April 2025. Original studies evaluating biopolymers in any VCA-relevant setting (<i>in vitro<\/i>, animal, or clinical) were eligible. Clinical quality was judged with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and pre-clinical studies with the SYRCLE tool. Given methodological heterogeneity, findings were narratively synthesized. Eleven studies published between 2014 and 2024 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Collectively, they demonstrate that biopolymers, ranging from decellularized limb and auricular scaffolds to collagen-hydroxyapatite or polycaprolactone bone substitutes, hyaluronic-acid-functionalized vascular grafts, chitosan- or alginate-based drug-eluting coatings, and extracellular-matrix (ECM) sheets delivering cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4-immunoglobulin (CTLA4-Ig) with or without rapamycin, consistently enhance vascularization, support multi-tissue regeneration, and preserve mechanical integrity across diverse VCA models. Immunologically, polymer platforms bias host responses toward tolerance: in a murine hind-limb model, ECM combined with CTLA4-Ig and rapamycin extended graft survival to 72 days while promoting pro-regenerative macrophage polarization. Drug-delivery applications also proved effective; calcium-alginate coatings prolonged vancomycin release for up to 50 days <i>in vitro<\/i>, highlighting the potential for infection control during graft integration. Notwithstanding these benefits, chitosan scaffolds displayed inadequate load-bearing capacity, and heterogeneity in species, graft types, follow-up intervals, and outcome metrics limited direct comparison and impeded meta-analysis. Biopolymers emerge as potential adaptable platforms that merge mechanical support with finely tuned immune regulation in VCA. Successful translation will depend on tissue-specific material optimization, standardized immunological endpoints, and multicenter studies that replicate clinical complexity. Drawing on lessons from solid-organ transplantation and fostering collaboration among immunologists, biomaterial scientists, and surgeons will be pivotal to moving these technologies from bench to bedside in VCA.","65":"Antibiotic use in infants is hypothesized to alter the gut microbiota, influencing immune system dysregulation and increasing allergy risk. We aim to assess the prevalence of allergic diseases in children treated with different classes of antibiotics in early life. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from April 2024 to January 2025 in three main hospitals in the West Bank in Palestine. Records of pediatric admissions of children who received antibiotic treatment within their first six months of life were reviewed, followed by parents' interview regarding the development of allergies. A total of 423 medical records were included. The average age of children was 7.33\u2009\u00b1\u20091.38\u00a0years (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD), and 62.41% of them were males. The total prevalence of allergic diseases was 29.55%. Common manifestations of allergies were skin reactions (70.4%), wheezing (16.8%), and respiratory symptoms (10.4%). Among the most common reported triggers were food (10.17%) and dust (7.33%). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were Beta-lactams; cefotaxime (78.49%), and ampicillin (63.59%). No statistically significant association was found between the number of antibiotics used and the development of allergies (p\u2009=\u20090.45). Similarly, different classes of antibiotics did not show an impact on developing allergies except for Trimethoprim\/Sulfamethoxazole (p\u2009=\u20090.05). A significant decrease in allergy was observed with increasing age (p\u2009=\u20090.011). Allergic conditions affect about one third of children treated with antibiotics in early life. While allergic conditions tended to decrease with age, no association was observed between antibiotic number\/class and later allergy, except for a hypothesis-generating signal toward lower odds with TMP-SMX.","66":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have improved clinical outcomes for some patients with advanced NSCLC, however a substantial proportion of patients remain treatment resistant. Here we analyze the NSCLC tumor microenvironment (TME) using multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) of biopsies taken from patients prior to ICI treatment. We apply a deep-learning model to classify the cellular phenotypes and probe functional and metabolic states of both tumor and immune cells, aiming to reveal predictive features of response to ICI. Tissue neighborhoods are generated to allow geometric profiling of spatial densities and interactions at a range of scales. Multivariate modelling of ICI response yields a model that predicts progression-free survival (PFS) over 24 months (AUC\u2009=\u20090.8). The selected features in the model imply a role for cell-cell proximities within discrete metabolic contexts. These tissue insights may supplement our understanding of the current paradigms around classical immunology in the NSCLC TME and its influence on immunotherapy outcomes.","67":"In the past decades, the connection between the immune system and Tourette syndrome (TS) has been explored as a potential pathophysiologic key aspect. This idea is supported by studies describing the effect of immune cells and inflammatory mediators in neurodevelopment by acting in synaptic arrangement, pruning, and maturation of neural circuitries. Supporting evidence for that correlation is varied, including genome-wide association studies, transcriptome analysis, animal models, and clinical populational-based studies. Moreover, the influence of environmental aspects typically involved in immunologic response and the association of TS with allergies and autoimmune diseases adds to the immune-based neurodevelopment theory. Overall, the research data looking at this association points toward a proinflammatory state, even though there is still uncertainty about the exact role and implication of this immunologic profile in TS, especially due to the lack of robust evidence regarding immunomodulatory treatments. Furthermore, the discrepancy of results in studies shed doubt on the immunologic hypothesis. In this chapter, we summarize the scientific knowledge regarding immunology in TS, discussing it from a historical perspective to more recent studies.","68":"To detect the expression levels of absence in melanoma 2 (AIM2), cysteine aspartate-specific protease-1 (caspase-1), and gasdermin D (GSDMD) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) and to explore their role in the pathogenesis of IIM. A total of 30 IIM patients (IIM group) who visited the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, General Hospital of Northern Theater Command from May 2020 to June 2022 were recruited. Concurrently, 30 healthy volunteers matched by gender and age were recruited from the hospital's Health Examination Center. Clinical information, biochemical and immunological mar-kers, and venous blood samples were collected from the study subjects. Serum double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) levels were detected by fluorescence quantitative method, and the mRNA expression levels of <i>AIM2<\/i>, <i>caspase-1<\/i>, <i>GSDMD<\/i>, interleukin 1\u03b2 (<i>IL<\/i><i>-1\u03b2<\/i>), and <i>IL-18<\/i> in PBMC were detected by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). The protein expression levels of AIM2, caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18 in PBMC were detected using the Western blot (WB) method, and the serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IIM group included 10 cases of dermatomyositis (DM), 5 cases of polymyositis (PM), 11 cases of overlap syndrome (OM), and 4 cases of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). Compared with the healthy control group, the serum levels of dsDNA, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18 were significantly increased in the IIM group and its subgroups (<i>P<\/i> < 0.05). Except for the fact that there was no statistically significant difference in AIM2 mRNA levels in PBMC of the IMNM subgroup compared to the healthy control group, the expression of <i>AIM2<\/i>, <i>caspase-1<\/i>, and <i>GSDMD<\/i> mRNA was significantly increased in the IIM group and other subgroups (<i>P<\/i> < 0.05); Except for the comparison of <i>IL<\/i><i>-1\u03b2<\/i> mRNA levels in PBMC of the IMNM and OM subgroups with the healthy control group showing no statistical difference, the expression of <i>IL<\/i><i>-1\u03b2<\/i> and <i>IL-18<\/i> mRNA was significantly increased in the IIM group and other subgroups (<i>P<\/i> < 0.05); Comparisons between subgroups indicated that the expression of <i>IL<\/i><i>-1\u03b2<\/i> mRNA in the DM subgroup was significantly higher than that in the OM and IMNM subgroups, and the expression of <i>IL-18<\/i> mRNA in the PM subgroup was significantly higher than that in the DM and OM subgroups (<i>P<\/i> < 0.05). The expression levels of AIM2, caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18 proteins in PBMC of the IIM group and its subgroups were significantly higher than those in the healthy control group (<i>P<\/i> < 0.05); Comparisons among subgroups revealed that the expression of IL-18 protein in the OM subgroup was significantly higher than that in the PM subgroup (<i>P<\/i> < 0.05). In the IIM group, the mRNA of <i>caspase-1<\/i>, <i>GSDMD<\/i>, and <i>IL-18<\/i> showed a positive correlation with <i>AIM2<\/i> mRNA, and the protein expression of caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18 also showed a positive correlation with AIM2 protein expression. The AIM2 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of IIM, providing a theoretical basis for further research on the etiology of IIM and the development of new therapies.","69":"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that is characterized by dysregulated cytokine signaling. Treatment outcomes for patients with UC remain suboptimal despite the advent of cytokine-targeting therapies, necessitating a better understanding of the interconnected cytokine signaling networks that are perturbed in patients with UC. To address this, we undertook systems immunology modeling of single-cell transcriptomics data from colonic biopsies of treatment-naive and treatment-exposed patients with UC to build complex cytokine signaling networks underpinned by putative cytokine-cytokine interactions. The generated cytokine networks effectively captured known, physiologically relevant cytokine-cytokine interactions, which we validated in vitro in colonic epithelial organoids derived from patients with UC and with organoids cocultured with innate lymphoid cells. These networks revealed several previously unrecognized aspects of UC pathogenesis. These included the identification of a cytokine subnetwork that is unique to treatment-naive patients with UC, of cytokines with altered interaction patterns across UC disease states (including IL-22, TL1A, IL-23A, and OSM), and of cytokine-cytokine interactions that were mediated by specific members of the Janus-associated kinase (JAK) family. In particular, our network analysis positioned TL1A as an important upstream regulator of TNF and IL-23A (both of which are targeted by approved UC drugs) and suggested it as a potential therapeutic target. Together, these findings open several avenues for guiding future cytokine-targeting therapeutic approaches in UC, and the presented methodology can be readily applied to gain similar insights into other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.","70":"Studies have demonstrated that repeated mRNA vaccination enhances the breadth of neutralization against diverse severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. However, the development of antibodies capable of neutralizing across the Coronavirinae subfamily is poorly understood. In this study, we analyze serum samples to determine their neutralization breadth and potency and identify their antigenic targets. Using a cohort of older individuals and healthcare workers, we track correlates of broad neutralizing responses, including fusion peptide (FP) antibody elicitation. We find that although broadly neutralizing responses are often a result of receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies, a rare subset of donors produce FP-specific broadly neutralizing responses. Interestingly, FP-specific antibodies are not observed in COVID-naive individuals, irrespective of vaccination regimen; rather, they occur following natural infection or vaccine breakthrough. This study highlights which epitope targets underpin broadly neutralizing antibody responses to coronaviruses and suggests that existing vaccines are insufficient to promote the elicitation of FP-directed broadly neutralizing coronavirus antibodies.","71":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains a global health crisis, ranking among the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. In response to the World Health Organization's call for therapeutic vaccines to complement antibiotic regimens and reduce tuberculosis (TB) treatment duration, we developed an intranasal DNA vaccine fusing the Mtb stringent response gene relMtb with the gene encoding the dendritic cell-targeting chemokine Mip3a\/CCL20. Administered alongside the first-line regimen, this vaccine accelerated stable cure in immunocompetent murine TB models, reducing lung inflammation and eliciting robust and sustained RelMtb-stimulated T-cell responses systemically and locally. The Mip3a\/relMtb vaccine enhanced dendritic cell recruitment, activation, and spatial coordination with T cells, suggesting improved innate-adaptive immune synergy. Notably, it augmented the efficacy of a novel drug-resistant TB regimen as well. Critically, the vaccine induced analogous antigen-stimulated T-cell immunity in nonhuman primates, the gold standard for preclinical TB vaccine evaluation, with responses detected in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage mirroring those observed in the murine models. These findings underscore the potential of this strategy to advance therapeutic TB vaccine development targeting Mtb persisters while providing a framework to define correlates of vaccine-mediated protection.","72":"We hypothesized that performing bone marrow transplant (BMT) using marrow extracted from the vertebral bodies (VB) of an unrelated deceased lung transplant (LTX) donor would be able to establish persistent hematopoiesis, generate immunity, and tolerance. A teenager with severe combined immunodeficiency with lung failure due to recurrent pneumonias underwent LTX in 2016 from a 1\/8 HLA allele-matched unrelated donor, followed by BMT 4 months later using T-cell\/B-cell-depleted, cryopreserved VB marrow. Rapid engraftment was followed by accelerating immune competence at 6 months, with independence from immunosuppression by 16 months. Donor T-cell (>95%) and myeloid chimerism (7-10%) have persisted for over nine years. At two years post-BMT, circulating T cells were hyporesponsive to host dendritic cells in vitro. T-cell receptor clonotyping revealed the disappearance of host-reactive clones, and T-cell RNA-sequencing exhibited downmodulated signaling pathways for cytotoxicity\/rejection, paired with upregulated immunomodulatory pathways, suggesting active suppression. In parallel, host monocytes upregulated certain signaling pathways, indicating active interactions between post-thymic donor T cells and host monocytes. In summary, durable hematopoietic engraftment, immunity, and tolerance were demonstrable for the first time in a recipient of BMT obtained from VB graft.","73":"Immunosuppression and metastasis are critical hallmarks of breast cancer, often linked to poor patient outcomes. The secreted cytokine chitinase-3 like 1 (CHI3L11) is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer samples and promotes an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment. Notably, CHI3L1 expression is elevated in metastatic patient samples when compared to the matched primary breast tumor. To investigate its role in breast cancer metastasis, we generated an inducible Genetically Engineered Mouse Model (GEMM) that overexpresses CHI3L1 in the mammary epithelium. Ectopic expression of CHI3L1 in the Polyomavirus Middle T (PyMT) mouse model of breast cancer suppressed anti-tumor immune responses, accelerated mammary tumor onset and enhanced lung metastasis. Mechanistically, elevated CHI3L1 expression in the mammary epithelium enhanced neutrophil recruitment, which subsequently degraded the extracellular matrix and increased the number of circulating tumor cells. These findings reveal a key mechanism driving metastatic dissemination and argue that therapeutically targeting Chi3l1 could enhance anti-tumor immunity and suppress metastasis.","74":"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has a\u00a0prevalence of up to 11% in Europe and the USA, making it one of the most common chronic diseases. Classification based on immunological endotypes is increasingly being integrated into the disease definition, particularly for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Depending on the specific mechanisms underlying chronic tissue inflammation, different endotypes are characterized. Genetic and epigenetic changes in the mucosal immune system play a\u00a0significant role in this context. Identifying endotypes can help to better understand disease heterogeneity and develop personalized treatment approaches. In part\u00a01 of this publication, we discussed the immunological classifications of type\u00a0IV hypersensitivity reactions (T1-, T2-, and T3-endotypes), while part\u00a02 focused on type\u00a0V hypersensitivity reactions (epithelial barrier defects). The aim of part\u00a03 is to describe type\u00a0VI hypersensitivity immune reactions and highlight their implications for extended diagnostics and treatment. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) recently published a\u00a0position paper presenting an updated nomenclature for immunological hypersensitivity reactions, now encompassing nine distinct immunological reaction types. The antibody-mediated reactions originally classified by Coombs and Gell as types\u00a0I, II, and\u00a0III have been expanded and described in greater detail. Direct cellular and inflammatory responses to chemical substances are defined as type\u00a0VI hypersensitivity reactions and are the focus of this third part of the publication series. In CRSwNP patients with type\u00a0VI hypersensitivity immune reactions, an imbalance between cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms\u00a01 and\u00a02 can be observed. This imbalance is exacerbated by COX-1-inhibiting drugs, leading to reduced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis and overproduction of leukotriene\u00a0C4 (LTC4) and PGD2. As a\u00a0result of the chronic mucosal inflammation, alarmins such as interleukin-33 (IL-33) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are released. These cytokines activate Th2 lymphocytes and type\u00a02 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), prompting the release of cytokines such as IL\u20114, IL\u20115, and IL-13. Expansion of the immunological classification to include type\u00a0VI hypersensitivity reactions represents an important step toward a\u00a0better understanding of the pathophysiology of CRSwNP. Identifying these specific reaction patterns-particularly those triggered by chemical substances-highlights the complexity of the underlying immune mechanisms and emphasizes the need for endotype-based diagnostics. Incorporating these insights into clinical practice allows for more targeted individualized therapies and marks another step toward personalized medicine in CRS.","75":"A COVID-19 booster dose has been found to be effective in our fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term beneficial or adverse effects among healthy individuals are not fully understood. We investigated the impact of the Pfizer-BioNTech-(BNT162b2) booster dose on plasma proteome profiles of fully vaccinated healthy individuals in a mimic of reinfection to understand the disease mechanisms and to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In contrast to prebooster, postbooster recipients exhibited a distinct proteomic signature following SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein stimulation. The gene ontology (GO) terms of biological processes revealed the five most significant functions enriched in stress and immune responses, especially via complement and blood coagulation systems. Likewise, the Reactome pathway demonstrated significant activation of complement cascade, platelet degranulation, and innate immune systems. Moreover, the protein-protein interaction network exhibited regulation of body fluid levels and acute inflammatory response. In summary, our study identified abundant dysregulated signatures predominantly associated with the complement, the innate immune system, and platelet degranulation. Besides eliciting humoral immunity, our study also found key proteins involved in blood coagulation pathways that could perhaps shed light on individuals exhibiting comorbidities associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, factors dysregulated following SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein stimulation may provide insights into pathways potentially implicated in post-vaccination reactions.","76":"Radiomic and transcriptomic analyses have independently identified features linked to mechanical thrombectomy (MT) outcomes. Here, we integrated paired radiomics\/transcriptomics of stroke clots to identify neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) enrichment as a predictor of first-pass MT success, assessing the potential to noninvasively detect NET enrichment using prethrombectomy computed tomography imaging. We performed radiomic\/transcriptomic analyses of 32 stroke clots retrieved by MT. Clots were segmented from pre-MT computed tomography angiography and noncontrast computed tomography scans, and radiomic features (RFs) were extracted using PyRadiomics. Differentially expressed genes were identified between modified first-pass effect (mFPE) success and failure using the criteria of log(fold-change) \u22651.5 and q <0.05. RFs significantly different between mFPE outcomes were identified. A NET enrichment score was computed from expression data, and RFs that differed significantly between low- and high-NET-enriched clots were selected to construct an RF signature predictive of NET enrichment. Immunofluorescence was completed on clots to provide ground truth NET labeling. A total of 44 differentially expressed genes were identified between mFPE outcomes. NET formation, neutrophil degranulation, and the NET signaling pathway were among the most enriched gene ontologies in the mFPE failure group, with related genes downregulated in the mFPE success group. Forty RFs were significantly different between mFPE outcomes. Of these, 4 were found to be predictive of clot NET enrichment. Immunofluorescence validated that transcriptomic NET signatures accurately reflected NET presence within clot tissues. NET enrichment in clots is associated with reduced mFPE success. With further validation, RFs extracted from prethrombectomy computed tomography imaging may serve as noninvasive biomarkers of clot NET content to aid in preprocedural MT decision-making.","77":"A central hurdle limiting the success of T-cell-based immunotherapies is the progressive dysfunction of T cells, known as exhaustion. Overcoming this exhausted state is therefore a pivotal objective in translational oncology and immunology. The advent of single-cell multiomics has fundamentally revised the once-prevailing view of exhaustion as a uniform endpoint. Instead, it is now recognised as a dynamic differentiation process comprising a spectrum of distinct cellular states. This spectrum is organised along a hierarchical axis, originating from progenitor-exhausted (Tpex) cells that retain proliferative potential and advancing towards terminally exhausted (Tex) populations with severely impaired effector functions. We undertake a comprehensive synthesis of multiomics data-spanning transcriptomic, epigenomic, metabolomic, proteomic and posttranslational modification (PTM)-proteomic layers-to decipher the interconnected regulatory programmes that dictate commitment along this exhaustion axis. From this integrated analysis, we derive a unified mechanistic framework that delineates the molecular drivers of Tpex cell fate determination and terminal exhaustion. Beyond its explanatory power for basic biology, this framework serves as a direct roadmap for therapeutic innovation, highlighting novel nodes for intervention aimed at reinvigorating the exhausted T-cell compartment. The practical application of these insights holds significant promise for enhancing the efficacy of established current immunotherapeutic platforms. KEY POINTS: This review is the first to integrate multi-omics evidence for constructing a dynamic regulatory map of T-cell exhaustion. It highlights the critical cross-omics synergistic mechanisms, such as metabolic reprogramming influencing epigenetic remodeling to drive cell fate. The multi-omics perspective presented directly informs novel therapeutic strategies.","78":"In human blood B cells exist in a variety of forms ranging from antigen inexperienced naive cells to long term memory cells, and antibody producing plasma cells. Historically the divisions between these types of cells have been defined by a few characteristic surface markers such as IgD, CD27 and CD21, but recent advances in single cell techniques such as high-parameter cytometry and single cell sequencing have revealed a greater diversity of populations. An expanding palette of markers has helped to better define B cell subsets but can be a source of confusion when overlapping cell types are identified using different sets of markers. In this review we will discuss the conflicting and overlapping phenotypic and functional identities of human circulating B cells with a particular emphasis on memory B cells. We also propose a framework in which five B cell markers; IgD, CD27, CD21, CD11c and a glycosylated isoform of CD45RB can discriminate the majority of B cell populations in human blood.","79":"The concept of a \"magic bullet\" in oncology-first envisioned by Paul Ehrlich-has evolved into one of the most dynamic areas in precision cancer therapeutics: antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). These biopharmaceuticals combine the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic agents through specialized linkers, achieving targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic compounds to malignant cells while minimizing systemic toxicity. This narrative review explores the molecular foundations, pharmacologic mechanisms, and clinical evolution of ADCs, emphasizing their transformative impact on breast cancer management. ADCs are structured around three essential components: an antibody that binds a tumor-specific antigen, a linker that ensures controlled payload release, and a cytotoxic drug that induces apoptosis once internalized. The interaction of the ADC-antigen complex leads to endocytosis, lysosomal degradation, and payload liberation. Depending on the properties of the linker and the permeability of the cytotoxic payload, the cytotoxic effect can extend to neighboring cells-a phenomenon termed the bystander effect. Advances in linker chemistry, such as the use of acid-labile, enzyme-labile, or disulfide-cleavable bonds, together with the humanization of antibody backbones, have significantly improved pharmacokinetics, stability, and safety. The evolution of ADC generations illustrates progressive refinements in bioengineering and therapeutic efficacy. First-generation ADCs, such as Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, demonstrated the proof of concept but suffered from high immunogenicity, poor selectivity, and heterogeneous drug-antibody ratios. Second-generation ADCs introduced stable linkers and humanized antibodies, exemplified by Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), which targets the HER2 receptor in breast cancer. Clinical trials such as EMILIA and HER2CLIMB-02 confirmed improved survival outcomes and reduced toxicity compared with conventional chemotherapy. Third-generation ADCs, including Trastuzumab deruxtecan and Sacituzumab govitecan, incorporate site-specific conjugation, higher drug-to-antibody ratios, and potent payloads capable of inducing bystander killing even in tumors with low antigen expression. Landmark studies such as DESTINY-Breast03, DESTINY-Breast04, DESTINY-Breast06, ASCENT, and TROPiCS-02 have positioned these agents as pivotal therapies across HER2-positive, HER2-low, and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes. Despite these advances, resistance mechanisms remain a significant challenge. These include antigen downregulation, overexpression of efflux pumps, impaired intracellular trafficking, and reduced payload activation. Nevertheless, the modular architecture of ADCs allows iterative optimization of their antibody, linker, and payload components to overcome these barriers. Future developments are exploring bispecific ADCs that target multiple antigens, radiolabeled or immune-activating conjugates, and masked ADCs engineered for selective activation within tumor microenvironments, all of which aim to further refine selectivity, potency, and therapeutic benefit. In conclusion, ADCs exemplify the convergence of molecular biology, immunology, and medicinal chemistry in the pursuit of precision oncology. Their progressive evolution from concept to clinic not only validates Ehrlich's century-old vision but also heralds a new therapeutic era in which cancer treatment achieves unprecedented specificity, efficacy, and improvement in patient outcomes.","80":"Imaging technologies have become indispensable for understanding immune responses across molecular, cellular, and organism scales. By enabling real-time visualization of immune cell behaviour in health and disease, imaging bridges fundamental immunology and clinical application. This Editorial introduces the ESMI Collection, which showcases recent advances in imaging immune responses that support translational research and the development of precision medicine.","81":"This review paper is a sightseeing on the molecular pathways of the DED, which culminate in the cascades of inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, oxidative stress, as well as the breakdown of homeostasis of the ocular surface. The article also discusses complications, and it explains the connection between conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcers, blepharitis, dysfunction of meibomian glands, recurrent corneal erosion, ocular neuropathic pain, and accentuating the systemic effects of conditions, such as Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Within the directions of such molecular pathways, the article analyzes diagnostic biomarkers, as HLA-DR, MMP-9, cytokine profile, and innovations in technologies testing. Associating clinical exercise with the molecular frontier will add a new dimension to how we style, achieve, and eventually treat complications associated with DED. Using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and SpringerLink, an extensive appraisal of recent experimental and clinical literature was carried out. To offer mechanistic and translational understanding, studies explaining inflammatory signaling cascades, oxidative and mitochondrial stress, extracellular matrix remodeling, neurosensory changes, and immune-epithelial interaction in DED were assessed. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), dysregulated matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2\/9), oxidative stress-induced epithelial damage, and abnormal neuro-immune signaling mediated by substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide are all closely linked molecular pathways that contribute to DED complications. Corneal epithelial fragility, poor regeneration, neurotrophic keratopathy, ulceration, secondary infection, and visual impairment are the results of these processes. Refined illness categorization and risk prediction are made possible by developments in molecular diagnostics, such as tear osmolarity, MMP-9, neurosensory biomarkers, and lipidomic and proteomic signatures. With the passage of research and progress in diagnosis with biomolecular science and technology, biomarkers such as MMP-9, lactoferrin, interleukin, and HLA-DR have brought the possibility of following the evolution, subtyping, and diagnosis of diseases. The recent revelations of the molecular biology of dry eye diseases raise the concern for a specific therapeutic approach that not only brings symptomatic relief but modulates molecular expressions as well. A vibrant combination of ophthalmology, pharmacology, immunology, bioengineering, and material sciences with regard to new therapeutic strategies and more refined delivery platforms. Such leveraging of molecular insight to provide specific interventions is needed clinically.","82":"Polymorphisms in genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region comprise the most important inherited risk factors for many autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD): both diseases are positively associated with the HLA-DR3 haplotype (<i>DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01<\/i>). Studies of two different populations have recently documented that T1D susceptibility in HLA-DR3 homozygous individuals is stratified by a haplotype consisting of three single nucleotide polymorphisms ('tri-SNP') in intron 1 of the <i>HLA-DRA<\/i> gene. In this study, we use a large cohort from the longitudinal 'The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young' (TEDDY) study to further refine the tri-SNP association with T1D and with autoantibody-defined T1D endotypes. We found that the tri-SNP association is primarily in subjects whose first-appearing T1D autoantibody is to insulin. In addition, we discovered that the tri-SNP is also associated with CD, and that the particular tri-SNP haplotype ('101') that is negatively associated with T1D risk is positively associated with risk for CD. The opposite effect of the tri-SNP haplotype on two DR3-associated diseases can enhance and refine current models of disease prediction based on genetic risk. Finally, we investigated possible functional differences between the individuals carrying high and low-risk tri-SNP haplotypes and found that differences in complement system genes C4A and C4B may underlie the observed divergence in disease risk.","83":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by immune dysregulation and widespread inflammation. Natural killer (NK) cells display marked functional impairment in SLE, including defective cytotoxicity and cytokine production, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we show that mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitophagy are key contributors to NK cell abnormalities in SLE. Using complementary structural, metabolic, and proteomic analyses, we found that SLE NK cells accumulate enlarged and dysfunctional mitochondria, exhibit impaired lysosomal acidification, and release mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol-features consistent with defective mitochondrial quality control. Transcriptional and proteomic profiling revealed downregulation of key mitophagy-related genes and pathways. These abnormalities correlated with reduced NK cell degranulation and cytokine production. We then tested whether enhancing mitochondrial quality control could restore NK cell function. The mitophagy activator Urolithin A improved mitochondrial and lysosomal parameters and rescued NK cell effector responses in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine partially restored mitochondrial recycling and reduced cytosolic mtDNA. These findings suggest that defective mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction are major contributors to NK cell impairment in SLE and that targeting mitochondrial quality control may represent a promising strategy for restoring immune balance in this disease.","84":"Despite transformative advances in antiretroviral therapy, HIV remains a lifelong condition driven by durable viral reservoirs, chronic immune dysfunction, and complex interactions with host biology, co-infections, and aging. While implementation science is essential to ensure that effective interventions reach populations most affected by HIV, implementation cannot succeed in isolation from continued discovery or from the political and social contexts in which care is delivered. This editorial highlights critical gaps in our understanding of sex-based immunologic differences, tissue-specific viral persistence, resistance evolution, and the long-term inflammatory and metabolic consequences of treated HIV-gaps that directly constrain the durability, equity, and scalability of prevention, treatment, and cure strategies. We further emphasize that successful translation depends on stable policy environments, sustained public investment, and trust-based partnerships with affected communities, without which even highly effective biomedical advances fail to achieve impact. Sustained investment across the full translational spectrum-from basic and mechanistic science through clinical, behavioral, and implementation research-is therefore essential. HIV research has repeatedly served as a model system driving advances across immunology, vaccinology, oncology, aging, and pandemic preparedness, underscoring its broader relevance to human infectious diseases.","85":"Cancer remains a major global health burden, with 19.3 million new cases and 10.3 million deaths reported in 2020. Conventional modalities such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy often fail to prevent metastasis or recurrence. Cancer vaccination, which mobilizes durable, tumor-specific immunity, has gained traction, and LNPs have become pivotal to this approach. Originally optimized for siRNA, LNPs' core-shell architecture protects nucleic acids, enhances cellular uptake, and enables efficient cytosolic delivery. Their clinical validation in infectious-disease messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines has catalyzed rapid progress toward oncology applications. Preclinical and early-phase trials have indicated that mRNA-LNPs encoding tumor-associated antigens or patient-specific neoantigens can expand cytotoxic T cells and elicit preliminary antitumor activity. Key barriers remain. Manufacturing cost and batch consistency challenge scale-up. Physicochemical instability necessitates cold-chain logistics and complicates global deployment. Reactogenicity and anti-PEG antibodies increase safety and dosing concerns. Within tumors, immunosuppressive microenvironments, heterogeneous antigen expression, and suboptimal lymphoid targeting limit the efficacy of vaccines. This review describes the advances in LNP design (ionizable and biodegradable lipids, PEG alternatives, ligand-mediated targeting), formulation strategies (thermostable and lyophilized systems), and delivery routes (intranodal and intratumoral) to overcome these bottlenecks. It also highlights synergistic combinations with checkpoint blockade, radiotherapy, and innate agonists, and examines emerging pipelines leveraging AI-guided neoantigen discovery and quality control. By integrating material engineering, immunology, and translational evidence, we identified failure points and proposed a roadmap for next-generation LNP-based cancer vaccines. The goal is to accelerate progress from bench to clinic, while improving manufacturability, access, and durable patient benefits.","86":"In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and demonstrated potential applications in medicine. However, their professional capabilities in specific medical subfields, such as immunology, still require systematic evaluation. This study systematically evaluated 11 representative LLMs, including DeepSeek, GPT, Llama, Gemma, and Qwen series, based on the Chinese National Health Professional Qualification Examination in Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology. The evaluation covered four dimensions: basic medical knowledge, related medical knowledge, immunology knowledge, and professional practice ability. Results show significant differences among LLMs. DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 achieve the best performance, with accuracy exceeding 90%. However, performance on professional practice ability tasks remained relatively low, highlighting limitations in complex clinical applications.","87":"Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE), also known as steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT), is a rare autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndrome with highly variable clinical manifestations. Pediatric cases are particularly underrecognized, contributing to diagnostic delays. We describe a 13-year-old female patient who developed subacute behavioral changes, including withdrawal, emotional lability, and progressive manic and psychotic symptoms, over 1 month. Laboratory evaluation showed markedly elevated antithyroid antibodies with normal thyroid hormone levels, and thyroid ultrasound revealed features consistent with autoimmune thyroiditis. Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies were unremarkable. The patient demonstrated rapid and sustained improvement following pulse corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and low-dose antipsychotics. Her clinical course, combined with serological and imaging findings, supported the diagnosis of HE presenting with manic and psychotic features. This case emphasizes the importance of considering HE in the differential diagnosis of acute and subacute onset psychiatric symptoms in children and highlights the diagnostic utility of thyroid antibody testing in such presentations.

The EMT immune signaling pathway provides a great perspective for designing personalized therapies. In this study, 1223 RNA-seq samples were obtained from the TCGA-BRCA dataset. A total of 381 EMT-related differentially expressed genes were analyzed and combined with clinical parameters, and the matrix was randomly divided into training and testing cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. The training cohort was used to develop an EMT signature, including <i>GKN2<\/i>, <i>FZD2<\/i>, <i>NDRG2<\/i>, <i>SCUBE2<\/i>, <i>ALX4<\/i>, <i>CCL19<\/i>, <i>SDC1<\/i>, <i>EZR<\/i>, <i>CPEB1<\/i>, and <i>HRG<\/i> genes, and the accuracy of this signature was validated by testing and GSE158309 cohorts. A risk score model and clinical parameters were used to establish a nomogram for predicting prognosis. The C-index (0.719), calibration curves, and model comparison with four previous studies demonstrated the reliability of the EMT signature, the biological phenotypes of which were tested for functional enrichment, immune infiltration, and tumor mutation. Additionally, patients' responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy were assessed. Our results showed that the low-risk group had higher immune infiltration, tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability levels, immune checkpoint inhibitor expression, tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion scores, and immunophenoscore, which could predict patient sensitivity to immunotherapy. Moreover, low-risk patients exhibit better sensitivity to chemotherapy. This novel EMT signature offers excellent potential for predicting the prognosis, tumor immune heterogeneity, and therapeutic responses in breast cancer.","89":"Chilblain lupus erythematosus is a rare, cold-induced form of chronic cutaneous lupus that can occur in both genetic and sporadic forms. It is characterized by acral skin lesions and is commonly associated with autoimmunity and type I interferon pathway activation. Diagnosis is based on clinical features and histological findings. While topical and systemic therapies can be effective, the disease is often chronic and relapsing. We describe a case of a 48-year-old woman with chilblain lupus erythematosus who achieved almost complete clinical remission following treatment with hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate.","90":"Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent regulated cell death mechanism, has recently gained attention for its crucial role in tumor progression and immune regulation. Gastric cancer (GC), one of the most common and deadly malignancies worldwide, remains a major clinical challenge. This study aims to systematically analyze the global research landscape, hotspots, and trends of ferroptosis in gastric cancer from 2017 to 2025, with a focus on its immunological implications. Publications related to ferroptosis and gastric cancer published between January 1, 2017 and April 22, 2025 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) and Scopus databases (n = 974). Bibliometric and visualization analyses were performed using R software (bibliometrix package), VOSviewer, and CiteSpace to explore publication trends, collaboration patterns, keyword co-occurrence, and thematic evolution. Research output showed a continuous upward trend, with China leading in publication volume, followed by the United States, Japan, Canada, and South Korea. Frontiers in Pharmacology and Frontiers in Oncology were the most productive journals, while Cell and Nature were the most frequently cited. The most prominent themes included \"immune checkpoint,\" \"tumor immune microenvironment,\" \"ferroptosis mechanisms,\" \"drug resistance,\" and \"non-coding RNAs.\" Notably, the STAT3-ferroptosis axis and immune pathways were identified as key translational targets. Ferroptosis has become an important research frontier in gastric cancer and is increasingly recognized as a promising therapeutic strategy to modulate the tumor immune microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy efficacy. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the global research landscape, offering valuable guidance for future studies in cancer immunology and ferroptosis-based therapy.","91":"Flavin and deazaflavin biosynthesis are highly conserved pathways in mycobacteria, including in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis<\/i> (<i>M.tb).<\/i> Flavin biosynthesis on one hand is required to produce FMN and FAD, two essential cofactors required to support the flavin intensive lifestyle of mycobacteria. Deazaflavin biosynthesis on the other hand provides F420, an important cofactor used by mycobacteria to curtail antimicrobial and immunological stressors. Given these crucial roles for mycobacterial survival and virulence, these connected pathways have been a recent focus of drug discovery efforts. In addition to providing these important cofactors, studies have shown that the intermediates of this pathway are required to produce metabolic antigens presented by the MHC class I related protein (MR1) molecule in mycobacteria. T cells restricted by the MR1 molecule, which includes Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAITs), have also been shown to play a key role during <i>M.tb<\/i> infection. These findings have made MR1 restricted T cells a prime target for vaccine development. In this review, we focus on what is known about flavin and deazaflavin synthesis pathways in <i>M.tb<\/i> and other mycobacteria and the distinct features in these species. We also cover the role of these pathways in the physiology of mycobacteria, as well as the status of small molecule inhibitors targeting this pathway. We discuss the current understanding of MR1 immunology in <i>M.tb<\/i> infection, based on studies in both animal models and humans. Additionally, we highlight recent findings on the diverse repertoire of MR1 T cell receptors that expand during infection and the current status of the MR1 ligandome. Most importantly, we discuss current gaps in understanding the importance of these pathways and explore how this knowledge could drive the development of therapeutics for mycobacterial diseases by targeting these pathways and protective MR1-restricted T cell responses.","92":"The oral microbiome changes across the lifespan and is modulated by behavioral and metabolic exposures. Tobacco consumption, suboptimal hygiene, and frequent sugar intake disrupt microbial homeostasis, thereby increasing vulnerability to chronic oral diseases. While diet influences systemic metabolic and inflammatory health, evidence describing persistent, direct ecological effects on oral microbial communities remains limited. The objective of this study is to synthesize mechanistic insights on how dietary patterns shape the oral microbiome and influence systemic inflammatory or metabolic risk. A narrative, non-systematic review was conducted through expansive literature exploration. Peer-reviewed original and clinical studies reporting defined dietary exposures caloric restriction, plant-based diets, inorganic nitrate and fiber intake, and high-fat or high-sugar processed diets, were qualitatively evaluated for mechanistic relevance. Plant-enriched, high-fiber diets, nitrate intake, and caloric restriction were associated with reduced oxidative stress, lower pro-inflammatory cytokines, and greater diversity of commensal taxa, suggesting improved ecological stability. In contrast, processed diets promote metabolic conditions that indirectly remodel the oral habitat, favoring dysbiosis and a niche permissive to periodontitis. The diet-oral microbiome-systemic inflammation axis is bidirectional and clinically relevant. Understanding both direct ecological regulation and indirect metabolic effects is essential to support precision nutrition strategies aimed at maintaining oral microbial balance and systemic inflammatory risk mitigation.","93":"Insufficient healing of the Achilles tendon remains a frequent clinical challenge, creating a need for early markers that identify patients at risk of impaired healing. To examine whether adaptive immunity contributes to these outcomes, we analyzed T cell subsets in blood and hematoma collected during surgery. Patients with a higher CD4<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell ratio at surgery reported more pain, showed reduced functional recovery, and greater tendon strain after 12 months. Conversely, elevated CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell levels, and the CD28-\/CD57<sup>+<\/sup> memory subset, coincided with more favorable outcomes. We then investigated how these cells affect tendon healing by co-culturing human tenocytes with CD4<sup>+<\/sup> or CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Exposure to CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells increased collagen type 3, IL-17 receptors and matrix metalloproteinases expression, indicating a shift toward impaired extracellular matrix organization. These results suggest that the CD4<sup>+<\/sup>\/CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell balance may serve as a prognostic marker and that modulating CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell activity or IL-17 signaling could improve tendon repair.","94":"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is an RNA quality control pathway that degrades transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs). While the role of NMD in modulating tumor antigenicity and immune evasion is increasingly appreciated, its interaction with splicing remains poorly understood. We uncover a mechanism by which the splicing modulators enhance tumor immunogenicity not only by inducing aberrant splicing events that generate neoantigens but also by suppressing NMD activity through the downregulation of SMG1. This stabilizes PTC-containing transcripts, potentially expanding the pool of neoantigens. Furthermore, we demonstrate that splicing modulation exerts enhanced cytotoxic effects in microsatellite instability (MSI) tumors, which are particularly reliant on NMD for survival. Expression analysis in patient tumors reveals correlations between SMG1 and drug-targeted splicing regulators, supporting a functional link between splicing and NMD. Together, our findings identify splicing modulators as inadvertent NMD inhibitors that simultaneously boost tumor antigenicity and can be used to selectively target NMD-addicted tumors.","95":"Evaluating demographically diverse antibody response dynamics remains relevant to developing better vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. Here, in 80 Ugandan study participants vaccinated with BNT162b2, CoronaVac or ChAdOx1-S, we investigated longitudinal neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) functions, correlating these with immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding dynamics to spike subdomains, receptor-binding domain, N-terminal domain, and S2, across variants. Neutralizing and ADCC responses differed by vaccine type and IgG subdomain binding profiles. S2-IgG binding and ADCC effector function dominated the immune response to CoronaVac vaccination, while BNT162b2 induced the most potent neutralizing antibodies. Overall, we reveal intra-population diversity in antibody binding, neutralization and ADCC among vaccinated individuals, many of whom exhibited elevated pre-vaccination S2-IgG, despite presumed absence of prior infection. There was confounding by vaccination scheduling amidst ongoing waves of infection. These data reveal distinct immunogenetic patterns in a sub-Saharan African population that could inform regionally tailored vaccine strategies and global pan-coronavirus vaccine development.","96":"The regulation of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) gene, PDCD1, has been widely explored at transcription and posttranslational levels in T cell function and tumor immune evasion. However, the mechanism for PDCD1 dysregulation at the posttranscriptional level remains largely unknown. Here, we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as a RNA binding protein in a methyltransferase activity-independent manner, which promotes PDCD1 decay with WD repeat domain 77 protein (WDR77) and Argonaute2. Furthermore, the type-I IFN\/STAT1 pathway transcriptionally activates PRMT5 and WDR77, thus enhancing PRMT5\/WDR77 binding on a conserved AU-rich element of PDCD1 3' UTR. Functionally, conditional knockout of either PRMT5 or WDR77 in T cells disrupts T cell effector function and sensitizes the tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy. Clinically, PRMT5 and WDR77 expression in tumor-infiltrating T cells are negatively correlated with PDCD1 expression and renders tumors resistant to PD-1-targeted immunotherapy. Moreover, fludarabine targeting STAT1 in combination with anti-PD-1 has a synergetic effect on suppressing tumor growth in mice. Overall, this study reveals that the RNA binding-dependent function of PRMT5 regulates PDCD1 and T cell effector function with WDR77 and identifies potential combinatorial therapeutic strategies for enhancing antitumor efficacy.","97":"Preclinical data demonstrating that luspatercept mitigates vaso-occlusive and anemia-related complications in the Townes sickle cell model provide a strong rationale for its evaluation in SCD patients.","98":"Traditional polysaccharide vaccines are constrained by streptococcus pneumoniae diversity. We propose a protein-based pneumococcal vaccine (PBPV) - formulated with conserved surface proteins P3296, P5668, PRx1, and pneumolysin (Ply) - that could potentially offer superior immune breadth independent of capsular polysaccharide serotypes. Here, we evaluated the multifunctional antibody responses induced by PBPV, including immunogenicity, Ply neutralization, opsonophagocytic activity (OPA), and such nonopsonic functions as NK cell activation (ADNKA), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) in a cohort of 50- to 69-year-olds. While PBPV showed shorter-lasting immune responses, including reduced Ply-neutralizing capacity, it provided broader cross-serotype protection than 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Correlation analysis identified distinct PspA-specific IgG subclass roles: P3296-IgG1 correlated with OPA, and IgG3 correlated with ADNKA\/ADNP; P5668-IgG2 correlated with ADNKA\/ADNP, and IgG3 correlated with OPA; and PRx1-IgG2 correlated with OPA, and IgG3 correlated with ADNKA. Critically, while no efficacy data have yet confirmed the protective effect of PBPV, its targeting of conserved proteins rather than capsular polysaccharides enables simplified manufacturing and expanded coverage, positioning it as a promising alternative to traditional multipolysaccharide vaccines.","99":"Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1-targeted (PD-L1-targeted) immune checkpoint inhibitors are revolutionizing cancer therapy. However, strategies to induce endogenous PD-L1 degradation represent an emerging therapeutic paradigm. Here, we identified proanthocyanidins (PC) as a potent inducer of PD-L1 degradation through an endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) mechanism. Mechanistically, PC exerted dual effects: First, it targeted and stabilized LKB1 to activate AMPK in tumor cells, subsequently inducing the phosphorylation of PD-L1 at Ser195 - a disruption that in turn impaired glycosylation of PD-L1 and promoted its retention in the ER. Second, PC directly bound to the E3 ubiquitin ligase SYVN1 to increase its protein stability, which strengthened PD-L1-SYVN1 binding, thereby accelerating K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ER-retained PD-L1. This cascade culminated in the activation of CD8+ T cell-dominated antitumor immune responses, accompanied by suppression of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells. In preclinical models of lung and colorectal cancer, PC exhibited synergistic antitumor efficacy when combined with anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) antibodies. Notably, PC also potently inhibited the progression of azoxymethane\/dextran sodium sulfate-induced orthotopic colorectal cancer in mice. Collectively, our findings unveil an antitumor mechanism of PC, establishing this small-molecule compound as an ERAD pathway-exploiting immune checkpoint modulator with promising translational potential for cancer therapy."},"url":{"0":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667243\/","1":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665962\/","2":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665950\/","3":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665945\/","4":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665937\/","5":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665934\/","6":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665856\/","7":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665132\/","8":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664986\/","9":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664637\/","10":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662881\/","11":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662190\/","12":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41661234\/","13":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660792\/","14":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660265\/","15":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41660253\/","16":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41659931\/","17":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41659303\/","18":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41659164\/","19":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41658695\/","20":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41658290\/","21":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41657915\/","22":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41655756\/","23":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41655346\/","24":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41653436\/","25":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41652589\/","26":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41652434\/","27":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41652394\/","28":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41651601\/","29":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41651542\/","30":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41651530\/","31":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41651524\/","32":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41651394\/","33":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41651377\/","34":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41650970\/","35":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41650248\/","36":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41649925\/","37":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41649757\/","38":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41649523\/","39":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41649478\/","40":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41648359\/","41":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41646975\/","42":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41646859\/","43":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41645895\/","44":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41645706\/","45":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41644275\/","46":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41642982\/","47":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41642724\/","48":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41642666\/","49":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41642002\/","50":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41641650\/","51":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41641269\/","52":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41640853\/","53":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41640162\/","54":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41639688\/","55":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41639564\/","56":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41639549\/","57":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41638952\/","58":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41638540\/","59":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41637659\/","60":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41637185\/","61":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41636909\/","62":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41636860\/","63":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41636199\/","64":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41635838\/","65":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41634755\/","66":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41634004\/","67":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41633731\/","68":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41633601\/","69":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41632832\/","70":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41632570\/","71":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41632540\/","72":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41632537\/","73":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41632530\/","74":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41632278\/","75":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41631862\/","76":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41631768\/","77":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41630529\/","78":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41630420\/","79":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41630133\/","80":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41629620\/","81":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41627595\/","82":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41627183\/","83":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41628153\/","84":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41627977\/","85":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41625776\/","86":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41625757\/","87":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41625620\/","88":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41625598\/","89":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41625144\/","90":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41624874\/","91":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41624833\/","92":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41624190\/","93":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41623480\/","94":"http
