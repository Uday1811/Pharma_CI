The mechanisms driving resistance to anti-PD1 in SCCHN remain poorly understood. Using the IMMUcan multi-omics workflow, we characterized the molecular and immune profiles of R\/M SCCHN progressing on anti-PD1 treatment and compared them to an anti-PD1-na\u00efve cohort. Tumor biopsies from anti-PD1 resistant SCCHN patients exhibited significantly more EGFR and MYCL amplifications, along with increased MYC pathway alterations. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that anti-PD1 secondary resistant SCCHN had increased CD8+ T cell infiltration with higher levels of immune exhaustion markers than primary resistant and na\u00efve SCCHN. Additionally, high B2M expression correlated with greater T cell infiltration and improved survival following anti-PD1 therapy. Tumor cell B2M expression was independent of TMB and PD-L1 expression, suggesting that B2M expression could serve as an additional biomarker for anti-PD1 response.","1":"To evaluate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) risk among new users of ertugliflozin versus sulfonylureas (SU) or thiazolidinediones (TZD) and incretin-based drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes. We used Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service adjudicated claims within the Innovation in Medical Evidence and Development Surveillance network to identify three new-user cohorts: (1) ertugliflozin; (2) SU\/TZD; and (3) incretin-based drugs. The outcome was a principal hospital discharge diagnosis for DKA. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated after 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching, separately for ertugliflozin vs. SU\/TZD and vs. incretin-based drugs. Subgroup analyses were performed based on baseline insulin use. After PS matching, baseline characteristics were similarly distributed in each cohort. For ertugliflozin (n\u2009=\u200942,907) vs. SU\/TZD (n\u2009=\u200942,907), the incidence rates of DKA per 1000 person-years (PY) were 2.95 and 1.49, respectively. For ertugliflozin (n\u2009=\u200942,247) vs. incretin-based drugs (n\u2009=\u200942,247), the incidence rates of DKA per 1000 PY were 2.76 and 1.06, respectively. For ertugliflozin vs. SU\/TZD, the HR [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 1.88 [1.17-3.02]; in non-insulin users, 2.34 [1.27-4.31]; and in insulin users, 1.17 [0.54-2.52]. For ertugliflozin vs. incretin-based drugs, the HR [95% CI] was 2.40 [1.40-4.11]; in non-insulin users, 2.84 [1.42-5.66]; and in insulin users, 1.87 [0.79-4.46]. Ertugliflozin was associated with a higher risk of DKA relative to comparators. HRs were higher among new users with no-concomitant insulin use than those with concomitant insulin use. Results were consistent with prior SGLT2i data and highlighted the importance of caution by both patients and physicians.","2":"Subcutaneous (SC) administration is often a preferred approach for biologic therapeutics, offering enhanced convenience, improved patient adherence, and reduced healthcare costs compared to traditional intravenous (IV) infusion. The growing demand for high-dose subcutaneous formulations (HiSubQ), particularly for drugs requiring large doses, has driven advancements and innovations in formulation, manufacturing, device development, and analytical characterization. However, HiSubQ development faces challenges such as protein instability, high viscosity, and complex manufacturing processes. Addressing these hurdles requires innovative protein engineering, formulation strategies, advanced drug delivery devices, and high-resolution analytical tools to ensure stability, injectability, and bioperformance. A strong interdisciplinary collaboration across formulation, device, bioperformance, and analytics is required to drive such innovation. This review provides an overview of SC drug development, emphasizing key advancements in formulation design, biopharmaceutic considerations, device integration, and analytical characterization. We propose tactics and high-level roadmaps that can enable the development of patient-centric solutions to meet the rising demand for SC biologics.","3":"Approximately 15-30% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) present with metastases at diagnosis, while up to 50% will develop metastases during follow-up. The integration of targeted drugs into standard chemotherapy has significantly improved clinical outcomes, with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies playing a crucial role in the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic CRC. In this context, high-quality RAS testing is essential. A national survey was carried out among 60 Italian laboratories to assess the state of the art for RAS testing. Based on the reported frequency of RAS mutations, laboratories were classified as \"in range\" (n. 35; RAS mutation frequency >42% and <56%) or \"outliers\" (n. 25; \u226442% or \u226556%). Considering the type of institutions, in Community Hospitals the percentage of 'outliers' is significantly higher than in Universities and National Cancer Institutes. Among the laboratories processing fewer than 150 samples per year, 'outliers' are more frequently detected in the group using Next generation sequencing (NGS) as prevalent methodology (n=10) than in the real time PCR (RT-PCR) group (n=4). In contrast, within laboratories processing more than 150 samples per year, the number of 'within range' laboratories (n=19) is more than twice that of 'outliers' (n=8) in the NGS group. The survey underscores the need for continuous training of stakeholders involved in molecular testing and a multidisciplinary approach to patient management. The authors suggest a similar evaluation in other European countries noting that beyond infrastructure and technology, personnel training and improved communication skills are essential for optimizing biomarker testing and personalized treatment approaches.","4":"The combination of doravirine and islatravir is under investigation as a fixed-dose, single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV-1. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of switching to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725 mg) from bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1. This phase 3, randomised, controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial was conducted at 49 research, community, and hospital-based clinics in six countries: Australia, Chile, Israel, Japan, the UK, and the USA. Adults aged 18 years or older with HIV-1, who were virologically suppressed (with a viral load of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) for at least 3 consecutive months on bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide and had no history of treatment failure or known resistance to doravirine, were eligible for the study. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule with a block size of three, to switch to oral doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725 mg) or to continue bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, once daily. Participants, investigators, study staff, and sponsor personnel were masked to study treatment; sponsor personnel directly involved in this analysis were unmasked at week 48. The primary endpoint, which was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment, was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach; non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95%\u2008CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05630755, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment. Between Feb 17 and Nov 17, 2023, 585 individuals were screened, of whom 514 were randomly assigned and 513 treated: 342 participants were switched to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725 mg) and 171 continued bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. The median age of the 513 participants was 47 years (IQR 37-58), 403 (79%) were assigned male and 110 (21%) were assigned female at birth, 158 (31%) were Black or African American, and 117 (23%) were Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. At week 48, doravirine and islatravir showed non-inferiority to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (viral load \u226550 copies per mL in five [1\u00b75%] of 342 vs one [0\u00b76%] of 171 participants) with a treatment difference of 0\u00b79% (multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI -1\u00b79 to 2\u00b79). The rates of adverse events (74\u00b76% [255 of 342 participants] vs 71\u00b73% [122 of 171 participants]; difference 3\u00b72 [95%\u2008CI -4\u00b77 to 11\u00b76]), treatment-related adverse events (10\u00b72% [35] vs 9\u00b74% [16]; 0\u00b79 [-5\u00b71 to 6\u00b70]), serious adverse events (4\u00b74% [15] vs 6\u00b74% [11]; -2\u00b70 [-7\u00b71 to 1\u00b79]), and discontinuations due to adverse events (2\u00b79% [ten] vs 1\u00b78% [three]; 1\u00b72 [-2\u00b73 to 3\u00b79]) were similar in the doravirine and islatravir group and the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group, and no deaths were reported. The combination of doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725 mg) has similar efficacy and safety profiles to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, and could provide a two-drug, once daily, oral single-tablet option without an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor for adults who are virologically suppressed and want to switch to a different ART regimen. Merck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck & Co.","5":"Doravirine and islatravir is an investigational, once-daily, single-tablet regimen containing two potent antiretrovirals with complementary mechanisms of action and resistance profiles. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching from stable, oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) to the fixed combination of doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725\u2008mg) in virologically suppressed adults living with HIV-1. This phase 3, randomised, active-controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial was conducted at 53 research, community, and hospital-based clinics in eight countries: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Adults (aged \u226518 years) with a viral load of fewer than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL on any oral, two-drug or three-drug ART regimen for at least 3 months, with no history of treatment failure, known resistance to doravirine, or active hepatitis B infection, were randomly assigned (2:1) according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule (block size three) to receive oral doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725 mg) once daily or to continue baseline ART for 48 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by the anchor antiretroviral drug class (integrase strand-transfer inhibitor [INSTI], non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or protease inhibitor) in the baseline regimen. The primary endpoint (assessed in all treated participants) was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 (analysed according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach); non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95%\u2008CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The safety analysis population included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05631093, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment. Between Feb 20 and Oct 24, 2023, 614 individuals were screened for eligibility, of whom 553 were randomly assigned to receive doravirine and islatravir (n=368) or baseline ART (n=185). 551 participants received at least one dose of allocated medication: 366 in the doravirine and islatravir group and 185 in the baseline ART group. Of these 551 participants, 332 (60%) were assigned male and 219 (40%) were assigned female at birth, and the median age was 51 years (IQR 41-59); 250 (45%) identified as Black or African American and 80 (15%) identified as Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. Doravirine and islatravir showed non-inferiority at week 48, with viral loads of 50 copies per mL or higher in five (1\u00b74%) of 366 participants versus nine (4\u00b79%) of 185 participants on baseline ART (difference -3\u00b76% [multiplicity-adjusted 95%\u2008CI -7\u00b78 to -0\u00b78]). Treatment-related adverse events were more common with doravirine and islatravir (44 [12\u00b70%] of 366 participants) than with baseline ART (nine [4\u00b79%] of 185 participants; difference 7\u00b72 [95% CI 2\u00b72 to 11\u00b76]). Rates were similar in the doravirine and islatravir group and the baseline ART group for any adverse event (79\u00b75% [291 of 366 participants] vs 83\u00b78% [155 of 185 participants]; difference -4\u00b73 [-10\u00b77 to 2\u00b78]), serious adverse events (6\u00b73% [23] vs 4\u00b79% [nine]; 1\u00b74 [-3\u00b72 to 5\u00b72]), and discontinuation due to adverse events (0\u00b75% [two] vs 2\u00b72% [four]; -1\u00b76 [-4\u00b79 to 0\u00b72]). One death occurred (in the baseline ART group) and was not considered treatment-related. No participants discontinued treatment as a result of protocol-specified declines in CD4 cell or total lymphocyte counts. Doravirine and islatravir is efficacious and well tolerated and would represent the first non-INSTI-based, two-drug regimen for HIV-1 treatment. With increasing concern over the potential development of widespread INSTI resistance, this once-daily, oral, single-tablet regimen could be a potential option for people living with HIV-1 requiring a change to their antiretroviral regimen. The safety and efficacy findings support the ongoing development of islatravir, a drug with long-acting potential.

Herein, we describe the evaluation of an S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor, MSD-914, using mouse and nonhuman primate (NHP) models of lethal EBOV. Mice were completely protected from severe disease and death at doses as low as 0.31 mg\/kg\/day administered orally. From the pharmacological data and a toxicokinetic study, a predicted protective dose was selected for rhesus macaques (RMs). Surprisingly, orally administered MSD-914 was unable to protect RMs at doses as high as 0.8 mg\/kg\/day despite providing similar exposure of the drug to the efficacious dose observed in the mouse model.","7":"Alkyl-substituted <i>N<\/i>-hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters are valuable alternatives to alkyl halides in Ni-catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling reactions because they are typically more stable, can generate alkyl radicals under reductive conditions, and are readily prepared from carboxylic acids. However, the range of aryl halides that can be coupled with NHP esters in XEC has so far been largely limited to aryl iodides. Here, we describe a general method for coupling NHP esters bearing 1\u00b0, 2\u00b0, and strained ring 3\u00b0 alkyl groups with aryl bromides. This method is compatible with a broad range of substrates, including drug-like aryl bromides, and operates effectively in various non-amide based solvents. The use of a homogeneous organic reductant is crucial for achieving high yields, as it enables precise control over alkyl radical generation from the NHP ester.","8":"The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antibody-drug conjugates into the metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) treatment landscape has advanced therapeutic strategies beyond platinum-based chemotherapy (PBT). We evaluated real-world treatment patterns and overall survival (OS) among mUC patients during the period between maintenance avelumab (maintA) and enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab approvals in the United States. This retrospective cohort study utilized structured and chart review data from iKnowMed, a United States community oncology electronic health record database, to identify adult mUC patients initiating first-line (1L) anticancer treatment (index date) between April 2020 and September 2022. Patients were followed from the index date until March 2023, the last patient visit, or death, whichever occurred first. Descriptive statistics were used to report treatment patterns. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to assess OS. A total of 597 patients initiated 1L treatments (ICI monotherapy: 47.9%, PBT: 40.7%, other: 11.4%). The median age at diagnosis was 74 years, and 76.9% were male. Among patients receiving 1L PBT, 39.5% received maintA. Among those who were not on prior treatment at the end of the follow-up, 32.7% and 11.3% of 1L-treated patients received second-line and third-line treatment. The median OS from the index date for 1L-treated patients was 11.8 months (95% confidence interval 10.4-14.2 months). Despite the approval of maintenance therapy, prognoses for mUC patients remained poor. ICI monotherapy continues to be a common option in 1L. Many 1L patients did not have an opportunity to receive subsequent treatment, highlighting the continuing unmet need for mUC patients.","9":"Romania's healthcare system struggles with the EU's highest rates of treatable and preventable mortality and the lowest per capita health expenditure. Critical issues include unsustainable financing, an entrenched physician-centered model lacking institutional accountability, delayed digitalization, and inadequate clinical research capacity, necessitating structural and paradigmatic shifts. The objective of this study was to synthesize multi-stakeholder consensus recommendations for comprehensive reform of the Romanian healthcare system, focusing on financing, service delivery, and human resources. This manuscript details recommendations from a multi-stakeholder consensus conference organized in April 2025 by the Aspen Institute Romania. Participants addressed topics including financing, patient-centered hospital models, clinical research, health innovation, and the European Health Data Space (EHDS). Consensus recommendations include: stabilizing national health insurance funds (broadened contributions, multi-year budgets); shifting hospitals to patient-centered, institutionally accountable models (transparent allocation, digital integration, eradicating informal payments); equitable hospital reimbursement (unified tariffs); accelerated digital transformation (EHDS alignment, national Electronic Health Record); enhanced clinical trial capacity (personnel, infrastructure, regulatory efficiency); and exploring regulated dual practice, contingent on successful prior reforms. Key challenges include transforming hospital culture, promoting digital adoption, and navigating the complexities of politics and finance. These interconnected recommendations form a roadmap for transformative reform, crucial given the untenable status quo. Success requires sustained political will, stakeholder collaboration, investment, and robust governance to create a financially stable, patient-centered, equitable, and innovative system.","10":"Nitrosamines (NAs) are a diverse class of mutagenic impurities encompassing both small molecules and structurally complex drug-related NAs, referred to as nitrosamine drug substance-related impurities (NDSRIs). NAs display a broad range of carcinogenic potential, from high carcinogenic potency to being weak or even non-carcinogenic. In vitro Ames tests, conducted with both rat and hamster liver-induced S9, and in vivo transgenic rodent (TGR) mutation assays have been used by pharmaceutical sponsors for hazard identification of NDSRIs. A comparative analysis of Ames tests and TGR results for 33 NDSRIs was performed and revealed an accuracy of 79% between the overall mutagenic calls in the two assays. For NDSRIs with positive TGR results, mutagenic potency estimates were calculated and compared to NAs with robust carcinogenicity and TGR dose-response data. Results from these NAs demonstrated a strong correlation between carcinogenic potency (TD<sub>50<\/sub>) and TGR mutagenic potency (BMDL<sub>50<\/sub>) (r<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.95), which supports the use of TGR data for both hazard identification and acceptable intake (AI) determination. By integrating quantitative risk assessment tools with TGR assays, this work contributes to a more robust framework for evaluating NA-associated risks.","11":"Sotatercept is a first-in-class activin signaling inhibitor, developed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This open-label single-arm, multicenter, phase 3 study was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sotatercept in Japanese participants with PAH. Forty-six adult Japanese participants with PAH on stable background therapy were enrolled and received subcutaneous sotatercept starting at 0.3 mg\/kg with a target dose of 0.7 mg\/kg administered every 3 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance at 24 weeks. Of 46 participants, 29 (63%) were WHO functional class II and 17 (37%) were class III. At 24 weeks, pulmonary vascular resistance decreased 99.2 (95% CI: -129.6 to -68.4) dynes\u2217sec\/cm<sup>5<\/sup> and, 6-minute walk distance (key secondary endpoint) increased 41.8 (95% CI: 27.8-55.5) meters. There were 6 (13%) serious adverse events (AEs) and no discontinuations due to AEs in the primary period. Safety was consistent with the known safety profile for sotatercept with AEs that were clinically manageable. In this study of Japanese participants with PAH, improvements in pulmonary vascular resistance and 6-minute walk distance were observed, consistent with the pivotal phase 3 STELLAR (A Study of Sotatercept for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension [MK-7692-003\/A011-11]) trial. These data suggest that sotatercept may be an important treatment option for Japanese patients with PAH.

Non-sterile drug products offer therapeutic advantages, manufacturing costs which permit wide patient access, versatility of dosage form and routes of administration which facilitate patient compliance. These advantages have resulted in an increase in the number and nature of non-sterile finished dosage forms. Regulations and standards require the provision of non-sterile drugs to controlled levels of bioburden, the absence of specified microorganisms and the absence of objectionable microorganisms. Thoroughly understanding the microbiological risks and control performance in non-sterile manufacturing is vitally important in the improvement in the quality and compliance of non-sterile manufacturing. Prior publications have reported the magnitude and characteristics for non-sterile product recalls and regulatory compliance shortfalls from 2004 to 2011 and from 2012 to 2019. The purpose of this review is to similarly provide a valuable contemporary update of the microbiologically related quality and compliance issues specifically associated with non-sterile drug products by reviewing drug recalls and Form FDA 483s. This includes evaluation of incidences of microbiological quality and regulatory compliance issues through more detailed abundance analysis. This data and information should assist in the risk assessment and risk management necessary in the manufacture of non-sterile products and beneficial to the pharmaceutical microbiologist.","13":"Improving care of patients with hyperlipidemia requires an understanding of the barriers physicians perceive in prescribing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapies. This study explores physicians' perceptions of time and resource burdens, identify perceived patient adherence barriers, and examine factors influencing physicians' decision-making in LDL-C management. This is a non-interventional, cross-sectional, online survey of US-based primary care practitioners (PCP) and cardiologists who recommended or provided lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) to \u226550 adults per month, practiced for \u22652 years, and completed the survey in English. The survey comprised multiple-choice, constant sum, and numerical questions about physician decision-making, patient management, and perceptions of patient attitudes\/behaviors regarding LDL-C management. Descriptive univariate analyses were conducted. 200 PCPs and 200 cardiologists completed the survey. Most physicians reported prescribing lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) and that patients declined injectable proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i). They attributed this refusal to cost\/insurance, fear\/discomfort taking injections, and a preference for oral therapies. Physicians viewed patients with a history of ASCVD, with LLT experience, and those with greater understanding of ASCVD risk to have higher LLT adherence compared to those without. Most physicians spent a median of 10 min in shared decision-making conversations, regardless of therapies they prescribed. They reported needing longer to instruct patients during adherence counseling for PCSK9is than for oral therapies. Our findings suggest patient, clinician, and system barriers may all hinder LDL-C management and adherence. A greater understanding of the association between perceived barriers and real-world behaviors will help optimize lipid management.","14":"The 19<sup>th<\/sup> Workshop on Recent Issues in Bioanalysis (19<sup>th<\/sup> WRIB) took place in New Orleans, LA, USA on April 7-11, 2025. Over 1200 professionals representing pharma\/biotech companies, CROs, and multiple regulatory agencies convened to actively discuss the most current topics of interest in bioanalysis. The 19<sup>th<\/sup> WRIB included 3 Main Workshops and 7 Specialized Workshops that together spanned 1\u00a0week to allow an exhaustive and thorough coverage of all major issues in bioanalysis of biomarkers, immunogenicity, gene therapy, cell therapy and vaccines.Moreover, in-depth workshops on \"Implementation Practice for the Newest ELN\/LIMS Systems\" and on \"Vaccine Cell-Based\/Functional & Molecular Assays as part of the harmonization of vaccine clinical assays global initiative\" were the special features of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> edition.As in previous years, WRIB continued to gather a wide diversity of international, industry opinion leaders and Regulatory Agency experts working on both small and large molecules as well as gene, cell therapies and vaccines to facilitate sharing and discussions focused on improving quality, increasing regulatory compliance, and achieving scientific excellence on bioanalytical issues.This 2025 White Paper encompasses recommendations emerging from the extensive discussions held during the workshop and is aimed to provide the bioanalytical community with key information and practical solutions on topics and issues addressed, in an effort to enable advances in scientific excellence, improved quality and better regulatory compliance. Due to its length, the 2025 edition of this comprehensive White Paper has been divided into three parts for editorial reasons.This publication (Part 2) covers in the Part 2A the recommendations on Biomarkers\/BAV, IVD\/CDx, Ligand-Binding Assays and Cell-Based Assays and in Part 3B the Regulatory Inputs on these topics.

The standard of care for unresectable MPM was platinum-based chemotherapy until the approval of immunotherapy in 2020. We examined treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, health care resource use (HCRU), and costs in patients with MPM to understand disease burden before the first immunotherapy approval. This retrospective study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare deidentified database in the US to select patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200965 years who initiated first-line therapy (1L, index event) for advanced MPM (regional extension or distant) diagnosed between 2007 and 2019. Eligible patients had continuous Medicare enrollment from the diagnosis date to\u2009\u2265\u20093 months post-index date, with\u2009\u2265\u20096-month follow-up after 1L initiation. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate real-world time to treatment discontinuation (rwTTD) and overall survival (OS). Data cutoff was December 31, 2020. Among 554 patients with MPM who initiated 1L, median age was 74 years; most were white (95.0%) and male (73.7%). The most common 1L regimens were platinum-pemetrexed (75.6%), pemetrexed monotherapy (8.5%), and bevacizumab-platinum-pemetrexed therapy (8.1%); the median rwTTD of 1L therapy was 5.3 (95% CI, 4.2-6.3) months. Of 554 patients, 300 (54.2%) initiated second-line therapy (2L), and 120 (21.7%) initiated third-line therapy (3L). Platinum-pemetrexed (25.0%) and gemcitabine (25.0%) were the most common 2L and 3L, respectively. Median OS was 16.3 (95% CI, 15.4-17.8) months, with 5-year survival of 7.9% (95% CI, 5.5-10.9). Mean per-patient-per-month all-cause inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and total costs were 0.04, 1.74, 0.18, and $11,432, respectively. The study highlights a substantial clinical and economic burden among patients with advanced MPM who received 1L chemotherapy in the years preceding immunotherapy approvals, underscoring the need for more effective therapies to improve outcomes.","16":"Pharmacokinetics (PK) has long been differentiated from pharmacodynamics (PD) and biomarkers, yet this distinction undervalues PK's translational relevance. In this Perspective, we propose that PK itself functions as a biomarker that bridges dose, exposure, and response. Using examples from target-mediated drug disposition, antidrug antibodies, cerebrospinal fluid PK, high-dose methotrexate therapy, and anti-infective pharmacology, we illustrate how PK serves as a measurable, predictive, and actionable biomarker that informs drug development, guides decisions, and advances precision medicine.","17":"The structural diversification of pharmaceutically relevant compounds presents unique challenges to catalytic methodologies that have been developed and optimized on simpler substrates that lack drug-like complexity. Herein, we report a general strategy for carbon-heteroatom (C-X) bond formation through reactions between a wide range of nucleophiles and Ni-based oxidative addition complexes (OACs) of drug-like aryl and heteroaryl electrophiles. These organonickel complexes are easily synthesized by oxidative addition of the corresponding electrophiles under electroreductive conditions using an inexpensive Ni precursor. Redox-induced oxidative coupling from these persistent complexes proved challenging, but mechanistic studies guided the development of a simple aerobic oxidation procedure to rapidly form C-X coupled products. Exposure of the organonickel complexes to ambient air forms a high-valent (peroxo)Ni<sup>(III)<\/sup>Ar complex intermediate that can undergo substitution with a variety of N-, O-, S-, C-, P- or halide-based nucleophiles, which are incorporated into the product. The breadth of this methodology was demonstrated by reactions with unreactive electrophiles, such as aryl chlorides, drug-like (hetero)aryl electrophiles, and small peptides. Finally, the aerobic chemistry was miniaturized to allow for high-throughput exploration of substrate diversity with an equally complex set of nucleophilic partners.","18":"Since the TGN1412 clinical trial failure to predict cytokine release syndrome (CRS) during preclinical trials, alternative <i>in vitro<\/i> models have become increasingly important for identifying potential adverse outcomes in early drug development. Considering this, in 2019 the IMI2\/EU immune safety avatar (imSAVAR) consortium was established, encompassing academic, industry, and regulatory organizations. ImSAVAR aims to deliver a broad range of tools to enhance our ability to assess the efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory therapies. In addition, imSAVAR uses the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept to describe immune-related adverse effects, such as CRS, thereby facilitating the discovery of new biological markers for clinical management and prediction of immune-related adverse effects in nonclinical development. ImSAVAR unanimously agreed that CRS and advanced cytokine release assay (CRA) development is a key focus with regards to immunological safety testing and hazard identification. The CRA field has rapidly accelerated in recent years, with the rise of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) to provide enhanced predictive immunological safety testing within a clinical setting. Here, we provide an up-to-date review of recent developments of advanced, <i>in vitro<\/i> CRA models, discuss how these advances may impact the future field of nonclinical toxicology and the understanding of immune-related adverse outcomes and offer guidance on appropriate model selection.","19":"Open-source statistical software development is increasingly the preferred solution for leveraging new statistical methods in the pharmaceutical industry. However, with a long history of relying on licensed analysis software, there are philosophical and organizational barriers to overcome. In particular, the sustainability, reliability, usability, and feasibility of maintaining open-source statistical software long-term must be ensured. Here, we describe the open-source revolution that is emerging in the pharmaceutical industry and how it facilitates greater scaling of innovative analytical methods in statistics. We discuss challenges to open-source software adoption and propose mitigation strategies. Furthermore, we illustrate the potential for open-source software development with examples of successful projects, which highlight the roles of cross-company collaboration, career paths, education, and community building.","20":"Induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is one of the major mechanisms for drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which requires accurate assessment for dose adjustments. This study aimed to develop a reliable method for isolating exosomes from rat and human plasma samples, quantifying several CYP enzymes in the isolated exosomes at the mRNA level, and further validating their utility for studying enzyme induction in both preclinical and clinical settings. We evaluated and validated exosome isolation methods from human plasma and serum samples using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) for physical characterization and RT-qPCR for exosomal mRNA quantification. CYP mRNA induction was quantified in plasma-derived exosomes from rats and humans following dexamethasone or modafinil treatment. Among six exosome isolation methods, the ExoQuick kit was selected and further optimized based on the high yield and purity of isolated exosomes. This workflow of exosome isolation and RNA extraction exhibited high precision and reproducibility, and demonstrated excellent assay linearity, with gene detectability and expression levels increasing in a volume-dependent manner from 0.5, 1 and 2 mL plasma samples. Following dexamethasone treatment in rats, significant induction of Cyp3a23\/3a1 mRNA was observed in both plasma-derived exosomes and liver tissues. Additionally, CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP1A2 mRNA in human plasma-derived exosomes were induced in clinical studies following 200\u2009mg and 400\u2009mg modafinil administration. We present a robust workflow for detecting several CYP mRNAs in plasma-derived exosomes and demonstrate proof-of-concept induction in preclinical and clinical samples. However, larger prospective studies are required to validate clinical utility.","21":"Prefilled syringes (PFSs) serve as primary containers for therapeutic peptides and proteins in combination drug products. Silicone oil, a lubricant in PFSs to facilitate plunger movement during injection, and the headspace from syringe fillings, have been reported to induce protein aggregation and particle formation as a result of the associated interfacial stress. However, their impact on the stability of peptide drugs is underexplored. In this study, we employed biophysical techniques, including size exclusion chromatography (SEC), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and thioflavin T fluorescence (ThT), to investigate aggregate formation, secondary structural changes, and fibrillation following physical stress on liraglutide in the presence of varying silicone oil concentrations, headspace, and agitation strength. In contrast to the minimal structural changes or formation of higher-molecular-weight aggregates observed under mild agitation or limited headspace, enhanced headspace and agitation promote fibrillation of liraglutide. Furthermore, we utilized advanced techniques to probe silicone-oil-liraglutide interactions and interfacial stress, including high-resolution label-free stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) for chemical imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for structural characterization. We observed, for the first time, the peptide adsorption on the silicone oil surface at submicrometer resolution by SRS. <sup>1<\/sup>H NMR showed line broadening and signal loss, consistent with peptide aggregation or surface adsorption, but no chemical shift changes, supporting the absence of strong, specific interactions. Therefore, our data suggest that the dual air-water and silicone-oil-water interfacial stress, rather than either alone, plays a significant role in liraglutide aggregation. These findings emphasize the interactive roles of several stress parameters, including silicone oil concentration, silicone oil interface, headspace, and agitation strength, on the stability of peptide combination drug products, and highlight the critical role of interfacial stress-induced biophysical instability.","22":"Data on cancer incidence and associated risk factors among women with HIV are limited. We investigated cancer burden among women with HIV. We included all women \u226518 years from the two large multicentre observational cohort collaborations (D:A:D and RESPOND). The primary outcomes were incidence of all cancers, HPV-related and common individual cancers including breast cancer, lung cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) from 2006 to 2021. Baseline was defined as the latest date of entry into local cohort enrolment and 1st January 2006 for D:A:D and 1st January 2012 for RESPOND. Participants were followed from baseline until the date of first cancer, final follow-up or administrative censoring-whichever occurred first. We assessed risk factors using multivariable Poisson regression by applying robust standard errors and determined a population attributable fraction (PAF) for key risk factors for cancers. Among 17,512 women included, median age at baseline was 39.5 years (interquartile range, IQR 32.5-46.0). Over 141,404 person-years (PYS) and a median 9.2 (5.5-10.1) years of follow-up, 832 women were diagnosed with any cancer; incidence rate 5.9 (95% CI 5.5-6.4)\/1000 PYS, 163 HPV-related cancers (1.1 [1.0-1.3]\/1000 PYS), 150 breast cancers (1.1 [0.9-1.2]\/1000 PYS), 94 lung cancers (0.7 [0.5-0.8]\/1000 PYS) and 72 NHL (0.5 [0.4-0.6]\/1000 PYS). Older age (\u226545 vs. <45 years), Southern Europe (vs. Western Europe) and smoking were associated with an increased risk of overall cancers. Lower pre-ART nadir CD4, time-updated CD4, and a prior AIDS diagnosis were associated with lung- and HPV-related cancer. In PAF analysis, smoking and HIV-related factors such as lower current CD4, nadir CD4 and HIV viremia significantly contributed to cancer risk. Our findings suggest that women with HIV older than 45 years, past or current immunosuppressed or current smokers could be candidates for intensified cancer screening and prevention.

However, performance is highly sensitive to transfection composition, feed strategy, and execution details; and vendor protocols often underperform without platform-specific optimization. We integrated Design of Experiments (DOE) with liquid-handling automation to develop a rapid, data-driven optimization workflow for CHO transient expression. Key factors and ranges were defined for an IgG1 expression and then extended to additional modalities, encompassing coding DNA, PEI transfection reagent, Feed A\/B and glucose, inert filler DNA, and the DNA-PEI pipetting sequence that governs brief pre-complexing. Using Response Surface Methodology executed on an automated liquid handler, we generated structured datasets and fitted predictive models that accurately captured main effects, interactions, and curvature. The optimized conditions increased average volumetric productivity by approximately twofold, improved harvest viability, and reduced coding DNA input by about 70\u202f% without detectable loss of product quality (SEC main-peak purity) within our tests. The settings transferred across multiple biologics modalities with consistent gains in titer. Automation eliminates variable\u2011volume manual pipetting in complex layouts, reduced handling errors, enabled precise short\u2011duration pre\u2011complexing steps, and accelerated model\u2011driven refinement. This approach shorten iteration cycles and de-risks early-stage process development for candidate therapeutic proteins.","24":"In the phase 3 EV-302 study, enfortumab vedotin-pembrolizumab (EV\u2009+\u2009P) significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) versus chemotherapy in patients with untreated locally advanced\/metastatic urothelial carcinoma (la\/mUC). We present a post\u00a0hoc analysis in a pan-Asian population. Patients from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand received 3-week cycles of EV (1.25\u00a0mg\/kg; intravenously; Days 1 and 8) plus P (200\u00a0mg; intravenously; Day 1) or chemotherapy (gemcitabine [Days 1 and 8] plus cisplatin\/carboplatin [Day 1]). Primary endpoints were PFS and OS. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Overall, 176 patients were included (EV\u2009+\u2009P, n\u2009=\u200994; chemotherapy, n\u2009=\u200982). Median follow-up was 28.9\u00a0months for EV\u2009+\u2009P recipients and 26.6\u00a0months for chemotherapy recipients. EV\u2009+\u2009P prolonged PFS and OS versus chemotherapy, reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 63% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.57) and death by 67% (HR, 0.33; [95% CI, 0.20-0.54]), respectively. Confirmed ORR was 72.2% versus 35.0%. Grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 66.0% of EV\u2009+\u2009P recipients and 68.4% of chemotherapy recipients. Most commonly maculopapular rash (11.7%) and hyperglycemia (10.6%) for EV\u2009+\u2009P and neutropenia (25.0%), anemia (19.7%), and neutrophil count decreased (18.4%) for chemotherapy. EV\u2009+\u2009P demonstrated a clinically meaningful survival benefit in Asian patients with untreated la\/mUC, with no new safety signals observed, consistent with the global EV-302 study. Results support guideline recommendations for EV\u2009+\u2009P as preferred first-line therapy in la\/mUC. NCT04223856 (registered January 8, 2020).","25":"Ubrogepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist approved for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. The mass balance and metabolism of ubrogepant was evaluated in six healthy male adults administered a single oral dose of [<sup>14<\/sup>C]-ubrogepant 50\u00a0mg (\u223c200 \u00b5Ci). Overall, the mean total radioactivity recovery was 92.4% (95% CI: 77.8%-107%) of the administered dose, with 82.9% in feces (95% CI: 66.7%-99.1%) and 9.52% in urine (95% CI: 7.78%-11.3%). Ubrogepant was eliminated mainly via metabolism, primarily via biliary\/fecal excretion. Approximately 42% and 6% of the dose was excreted as unchanged parent drug in feces and urine, respectively. The major circulating components of drug-related material (DRM) in pooled plasma samples were ubrogepant (55%), M15 (13%), and M20 (3.5%). M15 (glucuronide of methylated catechol) and M20 (glucuronide of mono-oxygenated ubrogepant [M8]) also were the main metabolites in urine, together representing about 2% of DRM. In feces, the main metabolites were the oxidative metabolites M6 (di-oxygenated ubrogepant) and M8, together representing about 29% of DRM. In vitro assays showed that ubrogepant metabolism occurs predominantly via CYP3A4.","26":"Medical information departments within pharmaceutical companies play a critical role in addressing unsolicited healthcare professionals' inquires with accurate, evidence-based, and balanced medical information through scientific response documents. Global response documents (GRDs) aim to harmonize information between global and local teams and the end product, the scientific response document. To address the challenges associated with the development and maintenance of global response documents and this harmonization, phactMI and Medical Information Leaders Europe (MILE) convened an international expert panel representing 11 major pharmaceutical companies. Over months of discussion and deliberation, the panel developed consensus-based best practices for the creation and management of global response documents. The experts contributed nuanced insights regarding optimal document structure and format that consider various stakeholders while maintaining medical accuracy. Consensus was achieved via a structured survey with a 75% approval threshold for each best practice. Overall, GRDs are essential tools for pharmaceutical companies, offering accurate evidence-based responses to healthcare professionals. While companies may respond to patient inquiries as well in different formats (verbal vs written), GRDs are exclusively intended for healthcare professionals currently. Best practices for GRD development include: being focused on a single topic, developed in a label-agnostic manner, utilize the most robust scientific information available, developed up to 12-15 months prior to launch, have regular feedback in a structured approach from local teams, follow internal guidelines and work instructions, and be peer reviewed internally whenever new data are added. In addition, local response documents or scientific response documents should be based on a GRD that is localized with appropriate documentation. Overall, GRD development is a collaborative and innovative approach (including interactive formats), supported by defined metrics (including response time) and ongoing updates to ensure global relevance and compliance.","27":"Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is an aggressive form of bladder cancer characterized by high rates of metastasis and recurrence. Given recent advances in the treatment landscape, real-world evidence on current treatment patterns and outcomes remains limited, particularly outside of the USA. This study aimed to describe characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes of patients with MIBC undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) in a contemporary real-world setting in Germany. Adult patients with bladder cancer (BC) who underwent RC between October 2021 and June 2023 were identified from two German claims databases (AOK PLUS, GWQ). Patients with partial cystectomy, secondary malignant neoplasms, immunotherapies for metastatic disease prior to RC, radiotherapy, or in situ disease \u2264\u20096\u00a0months pre-RC were excluded. Patient characteristics and treatment patterns (neoadjuvant [NAT, \u2264\u20096\u00a0months pre-RC] and adjuvant periods [AT, \u2264\u20096\u00a0months post-RC]) were investigated in a descriptive analysis. Time to recurrence (from RC until end of follow-up [study period end: Dec 31, 2023]) was assessed as an exploratory outcome. The study sample included 319 patients from AOK PLUS (n\u2009=\u2009243 male patients, n\u2009=\u200976 female patients; mean age 71.4\u2009\u00b1\u20099.7\u00a0years) and 273 patients from GWQ (n\u2009=\u2009227 male patients, n\u2009=\u200946 female patients; mean age 68.6\u2009\u00b1\u200910.1\u00a0years). Surgery without NAT\/AT was the most common treatment (75.9% AOK, 74.0% GWQ). NAT and AT therapy utilization was low (NAT: 12.5% AOK, 17.2% GWQ; AT: 12.5% AOK, 12.1% GWQ; NAT and AT: 0.9% AOK, 3.3% GWQ). The most common adjuvant therapies received were chemotherapy (8.5% AOK, 7.0% GWQ) followed by immunotherapy\/nivolumab (3.8% AOK, 4.8% GWQ), while\u2009<\u20092.5% received radiotherapy. The 12- and 24-month recurrence-free survival rates were 76.5% and 67.2% (AOK) and 73.7% and 69.6% (GWQ), respectively. The most prevalent treatment approach for MIBC was RC alone (in the absence of NAT or AT). The uptake of new therapeutic options, such as adjuvant nivolumab, in the real world was low, highlighting underutilization of available therapies.","28":"Prefilled syringes (PFS) and autoinjectors are increasingly used to deliver biologic drug products, particularly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), to improve convenience, compliance, and dosing accuracy. However, these systems face performance and quality challenges such as needle clogging, particularly for high-concentration, viscous, and aggregation-prone formulations. The origins and mechanisms by which device-derived leachables influence clogging and protein stability remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated zinc (Zn) leaching from rigid needle shields (RNS) and its interactions with a high-concentration dupilumab formulation and common excipients. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) quantification shows that Zn was the predominant metal in RNS batches, and its extraction kinetics depended strongly on time, temperature, and the presence of a routinely utilized surfactant, polysorbate 80 (PS-80). Stressing RNS materials in the dupilumab formulation at 40 \u00b0C for 14 days yielded up to 550 \u03bcg\/mL Zn(II), roughly 100-fold above typical specifications. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed millimolar Zn(II) binding to PS-80 and weaker interaction with buffer components (histidine, arginine, and acetate), which together promote Zn release. Structural modeling identified surface-exposed regions of dupilumab enriched in histidine-, sulfur-, and carboxylic-acid-containing residues that are geometrically arranged to chelate Zn(II), highlighting likely Zn(II) binding motifs. These protein-metal and excipient-metal interactions, along with PS-80 degradation catalyzed by Zn, correlate with increased solution viscosity and the formation of high-molecular-weight species. Zn leaching from RNS and its synergistic interactions with PS-80, buffer components, and the mAb can drive PS-80 degradation, increase viscosity, and promote higher-order protein aggregation, factors that plausibly contribute to needle clogging. Overall, Zn(II) can simultaneously interact with proteins, increasing their propensity to aggregate while degrading the excipients intended to stabilize them against aggregation. Understanding these mechanisms can inform candidate selection, formulation design, and device choice to mitigate protein aggregation and syringe clogging and improve product reliability and therapeutic outcomes.","29":"Polysorbates are commonly used in biotherapeutic drug formulations, but their stability over the course of the product's shelf life is a matter of concern. An industry-wide survey involving 15 biopharmaceutical companies found that 23 biotherapeutic drug products (DPs) in clinical development exhibited significant reductions in polysorbate (PS) content during long-term storage at 2-8 \u00b0C. In all cases, this decline did not impact critical quality attributes (CQAs), except for the formation of fatty acid (FA)-related sub-visible particles (SVP) in 7 DPs and FA-visible particles (VP) in 1 DP. Particle formation predominantly resulted from enzymatic or uncharacterized degradation mechanisms, not oxidative pathways. Corrective measures, such as optimization of downstream purification or reformulation, were undertaken only when SVP levels exceeded acceptable thresholds. For PS20 and PS80, the levels of FAs generated were estimated and translated into predicted SVP levels based on theoretical assumptions. Additionally, the current understanding of PS degradation in biopharmaceuticals, based on the latest literature, is summarized, with consideration of safety and immunogenicity aspects related to the primary PS degradation products. Overall, PS degradation is considered manageable and not problematic under practical conditions. Enzymatic hydrolysis of PS is generally deemed acceptable, provided that all CQAs are maintained within specified limits. If FA-related particles are formed it is recommended that the PS degradation pathway is well characterized, and an appropriate control strategy be implemented.","30":"Poloxamer 188 (P188) is an alternative surfactant to polysorbates in biologic formulations, stabilizing biotherapeutic drugs in solution. By mitigating the inherent risk of polysorbate 20\/80 (PS 20\/80) degradation by host cell proteins, P188 ensured product integrity. In cell culture, it is used to minimize bubble formation and reduce shear stress. However, P188's susceptibility to chemical degradation necessitates vigilant monitoring during production, formulation, and storage to ensure biotherapeutic quality and patient safety. The complex composition of P188 poses a significant analytical challenge for its characterization and quantification in the pharmaceutical industry. In this work, we demonstrate two liquid chromatography (LC) methods that can be coupled with either a mass spectrometer (MS) for characterization and measurement of intact P188 and its degradants or a charged aerosol detector (CAD) for quantitative analysis. First, a reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) method was developed for the characterization of P188 raw material in solution. Second, a strong anion exchange liquid chromatography (SAX-LC) method was developed for the direct measurement of the poloxamer in biotherapeutic drug products. After online separation via the LC methods mentioned above, we utilize charge reduction mass spectrometry and two-dimensional ion density mapping visualization for rapid profiling, fingerprinting, and speciation of this polymer excipient. This approach offers a streamlined ion map for comprehensive identification of P188 species and their mass distribution in detail, including poloxamers, poly-(ethylene oxides), and poly-(propylene oxides). The graphical representation of the data in two dimensions facilitates the visualization of these characteristics, enabling a prompt diagnosis of the purity and stability of P188. Consequently, both drug substances and drug products formulated with P188 can be directly analyzed, preserving high-integrity sample information. Simplified workflow and computer-assisted data processing also help increase the throughput.","31":"Protecting groups have become standard tools for mitigating chemoselectivity challenges in complex molecule synthesis, but the inefficiency inherent to standalone protecting group manipulations and the difficulties frequently encountered with protecting group cleavage from polyfunctional molecules are outstanding problems associated with their usage. Leveraging routinely used protecting groups as handles for desired functionalization steps would eliminate these drawbacks while retaining the important function of suppressing undesired reactivity. The chemistry reported herein achieves this goal by enabling the direct amidation of tertiary N-benzylamines under mild conditions, yielding medicinally important acrylamides as well as a variety of other amides with high yields and broad functional group tolerance. The method is easily implemented and we showcase its utility in the endgame synthesis of sensitive acrylamide Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), including the KRAS<sup>G12C<\/sup> inhibitor MK-1084.","32":"The most common treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is radical cystectomy (RC), typically combined with neoadjuvant and\/or adjuvant therapy. This study aimed to describe patient characteristics, treatment patterns, recurrence, and overall survival (OS) among a contemporary cohort of patients with MIBC who underwent RC. This retrospective study included adult patients with MIBC (T2-T4aN0M0\/T1-T4aN1M0) who underwent RC between January 1, 2008 and July 31, 2023 and were captured in the U.S. ConcertAI Patient360\u2122 Bladder Cancer electronic medical record database. Index date was defined as the date of RC. Recurrence (first evidence of disease following RC) and OS were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and stratified by disease stage and treatment received. The association of recurrence with OS was assessed using Cox regression. A total of 783 RC-treated MIBC patients were included (median age 68 years; male 78.8%; White 87.6%; de novo MIBC 77.1%; pure urothelial histology 76.6%), with a median follow-up of 26.2 months. Neoadjuvant therapy use increased from 30.3% in 2011-2013 to 67.9% in 2020-2022. Among patients who received neoadjuvant therapy, 26.3% achieved pathological complete response (pT0N0) at RC. The 5-year recurrence and OS rates were 45.2% and 48.2%, respectively, varying by stage and treatments received. Mortality was 4.4 times higher [95% CI: 3.5, 5.6] among patients with recurrence compared with those without. Despite increased utilization of perioperative therapy over the past 2 decades, MIBC patients undergoing RC continue to experience high rates of disease recurrence, which are associated with increased mortality.","33":"Pneumonitis is a notable toxicity of lung cancer therapies, particularly radiation and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Racial and ethnic disparities in pneumonitis risk exist, yet heterogeneity remains understudied. This study aimed to quantify pneumonitis incidence among East and Southeast Asian patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A systematic literature review (SLR) and single-arm meta-analysis were conducted following Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and 5 local language databases were searched for studies published from January 1, 2014 to August 2, 2023. Included were clinical trials in Asian patients undergoing pharmacological or radiation therapy for NSCLC or SCLC. The SLR included 218 trials (NSCLC: 202, SCLC: 16). Pooled incidence of all-grade, grade 1 to 2, and grade 3 to 5 pneumonitis in NSCLC was 5.42% (95% CI, 4.25-6.89), 3.58% (95% CI, 2.54-5.03) and 1.34% (95% CI, 1.06-1.70), respectively. For SCLC, pooled incidence was 12.21% (95% CI, 4.77-27.85), 7.64% (95% CI, 2.48-21.23), and 2.43% (95% CI, 1.47-3.97), respectively. Significantly higher rates of pneumonitis were observed in patients receiving chemoradiation or radiation-containing treatments, in general, compared to those not treated with radiation; grade 3 to 5 events in SCLC were not significantly different. This study establishes baseline pneumonitis risk in East and Southeast Asian patients treated for NSCLC and SCLC, highlighting higher incidence in those receiving radiation-containing treatments, particularly for lower-grade events. The results help contextualize safety data from clinical trials enrolling Asian patients.","34":"High levels of DNA replication stress and defects in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways are vulnerabilities of many poor prognosis childhood malignancies. Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) is a key regulator of these pathways and constitutes an attractive target, especially in combination. However, the malignancies where ATR inhibitors have maximum benefit and synergistic combinations differ between adults and children. ACCELERATE convened a multistakeholder meeting and conducted review and analysis to propose the optimal pathway for the development of ATR inhibitors in pediatric malignancies. Considering the lack of identified biomarkers, the initial evaluation of ATR inhibitors should focus on Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma in view of their high levels of DNA replication stress and defects in DDR pathways. Early phase trials of ATR inhibitors should be iterative, based on a clear hypothesis with responders and nonresponders undergoing detailed molecular analysis and a revised new hypothesis generated. Trial designs should restrict monotherapy evaluation to a brief exposure in a small number of patients and progress rapidly to combinations. Highlighted combination partners are poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors and antibody drug conjugates with topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads. Combinations with ALK inhibitors (in <i>ALK<\/i>\/<i>MYCN<\/i>-aberrant neuroblastoma) and aurora A kinase (in <i>MYCN<\/i>-amplified) are supported by robust mechanisms of action and preclinical data. Early interactions with regulators are crucial, and early phase clinical trials should be conducted in regulatory-approved, academic-sponsored, industry-supported, platform trials. ATR inhibitors are a prototype for the development of medicinal products in a limited pediatric population. For the substantial potential of ATR inhibitors in children with malignancy to be realized, strategic planning between academia, industry, regulators, and patient advocates is vital.","35":"High-throughput analysis has become a critical component in chemical biology and analytical chemistry due to the large libraries of compounds that are screened every day for drug development. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is the methodology of choice for large-scale identification and quantification of protein modifications, both chemically deposited and biological post-translational modifications (PTMs). With the advent of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and other novel protein-based conjugates, the demand for such an analysis has skyrocketed. Here, we present a new protocol that achieves quantitative data for modified peptides in approximately 30 s of MS acquisition time. This platform includes a direct injection MS approach coupled with new software named iFishMass to extract targeted signals from hundreds of runs. iFishMass automatically generates plots and statistics. This platform will enable a faster analysis of synthetic modifications installed on monoclonal antibodies to create ADCs, and it is potentially scalable to biological PTMs. Sample preparation can be parallelized for 384 samples by using multichannel pipettes and 96-well plates, paving the way to an inexpensive but effective platform for high-throughput screening of conjugation sites on proteins.","36":"The phase 3 KEYNOTE-522 study in high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) showed significantly improved efficacy outcomes with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. We present findings from the KEYNOTE-522 Japan subgroup. Eligible participants (aged\u2009\u2265\u200918\u2009years) with untreated locally advanced TNBC (stage T1c N1-2 or T2-4 N0-2) were randomized 2:1 to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200\u2009mg or placebo plus chemotherapy every 3\u2009weeks for 8\u2009cycles followed by surgery and adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for \u2264\u20099 cycles. Primary endpoints were pathologic complete response (pCR; ypT0\/Tis ypN0) at the time of surgery and event-free survival (EFS). Of 76 participants enrolled in Japan, 45 were randomized to the pembrolizumab arm and 31 to the placebo arm. Median time from randomization to data cutoff (March 22, 2024) was 76.3\u2009months. Twenty-four participants (53%) in the pembrolizumab arm and 15 (48%) in the placebo arm achieved pCR (between-treatment arm difference, 4.9%; 95% CI, -17.6% to 27.1%); findings were similar regardless of PD-L1 expression. Rates of EFS at 60\u2009months were 84% and 73%, respectively (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.20-1.50). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 37 of 45 participants (82%) treated with pembrolizumab and 23 of 30 participants (77%) treated with placebo; there were no grade 5 AEs. In conclusion, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab showed improved efficacy outcomes and manageable safety versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone in Japanese participants, supporting the use of this regimen in Japanese patients with high-risk early-stage TNBC. Trial Registration: The study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03036488) was conducted in compliance with local and\/or national regulations and International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and in accordance with the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki.","37":"The presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients indicates post-treatment molecular residual disease (MRD). Given the complexity of ctDNA-based MRD detection tests, consensus on analytical validation (AV) criteria is needed. To address this, the Blood Profiling Atlas in Cancer (BLOODPAC) Consortium's MRD AV Working Group evaluated existing protocols to develop standardized guidance for tumor-informed assays. Protocols pertaining to blood collection tube types, quantitative output, tissue processing, tumor or matched normal sequencing, software, and clinical validation were considered out of scope. After alignment on objectives and assumptions, study designs on the basis of best practices in the field, available assay validation guidance documents, and unique performance challenges for tumor-informed MRD assays were authored. Each protocol contains introduction, experimental design, statistical analysis, and an example data presentation per the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health standard format. Biostatisticians were consulted to define minimal test requirements, sample size, and appropriate statistical analyses. The protocols were submitted to the FDA via the presubmission process for formal written feedback followed by a meeting. BLOODPAC's generic protocols for the AV of tumor-informed ctDNA assays for MRD are designed to provide test developers with a core baseline of standardized AV protocols such that methods described can be adapted and applied for any tumor-informed MRD assay irrespective of technology, panel design algorithm, or workflow component. These protocols aim to optimize test developers' presubmission reviews with the FDA, ensuring productive meetings while enabling reviewers to streamline feedback. As always, test developers are encouraged to communicate with FDA directly around their particular AV methods.","38":"A focus group organised by the Drug Safety Research Unit (DSRU) International Working Group (IWG) on New Developments in Pharmacovigilance discussed current challenges and opportunities in pharmacovigilance (PV), emphasising the need for a multimodal approach in data analysis and accessibility of diverse data sources for drug safety surveillance. Nine participants, selected purposefully for their multisectoral expertise in PV, discussed the value of various data types, including data from clinical trials and real-world data (RWD), each offering distinct strengths and limitations. Key challenges identified included data standardisation, quality variability, technological barriers and ethical concerns, particularly with data derived from social media. Emerging tools such as knowledge graphs were highlighted for their potential to enhance data integration and signal detection, however further research is required. The group also addressed disparities in data access, with particular attention to regulatory restrictions, limited infrastructure in low-resource settings and restricted access to industry-held data. Proposed solutions included fostering greater data transparency, establishing secure data-sharing platforms and forming collaborative consortia to facilitate responsible and ethical data use. Overall, the discussion underscored the need for improved integration, access and methodological rigour to strengthen PV practices and enhance global drug safety monitoring.","39":"MK-7602 is a first-in-class dual-plasmepsin inhibitor being developed to treat malaria. Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of MK-7602 following single and multiple doses were evaluated in two phase 1 studies (7602-001; 7602-002). Study 7602-001 included two parts: part 1, a randomized, single-ascending-dose (10-400 mg), placebo-controlled, double-blind study (<i>n<\/i> = 24); and part 2, a non-randomized, fixed-sequence, open-label study (<i>n<\/i> = 12) to assess the effect of itraconazole (200 mg), a cytochrome P450 3A and P-glycoprotein inhibitor, on the PK of MK-7602 (25 mg). Study 7602-002 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending-dose study (<i>n<\/i> = 40); participants received MK-7602 (50-300 mg) or placebo for 7 days. Single and multiple doses of MK-7602 were generally well tolerated. Headaches were the most common adverse event (7602-001 part 1: 54.5%; 7602-002: 36.7%). MK-7602 median time to maximal concentration (<i>T<\/i><sub>max<\/sub>) was 1.5-3.0 h, with dose-proportional increases in maximum concentration (<i>C<\/i><sub>max<\/sub>) and the area under the curve over the dosing interval (AUC<sub>0-tau<\/sub>) at single and multiple doses of \u226550 mg. Terminal half-life was 31.3-41.4 h following multiple dosing, the accumulation ratio for daily dosing was 1.03-2.20, and steady-state concentrations were reached by day 3. Coadministration with itraconazole resulted in a 6- and 12-fold increase in <i>C<\/i><sub>max<\/sub> and area under the concentration-time curve to infinity, respectively. The primary hypothesis that a well-tolerated dose of MK-7602 would achieve a trough concentration of \u22650.017 \u03bcM was met in both studies. Safety and PK characteristics support continued development of MK-7602.","40":"No abstract available","41":"Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, is a cornerstone of treatment regimens for highly drug-resistant tuberculosis but cannot be used in drug-susceptible disease because of toxicity. This toxicity results from inhibition of mammalian mitochondrial protein synthesis. Here we show the development of a new oxazolidinone, MK-7762, with antitubercular activity that is better than linezolid and limited mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition. The cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the stalled mycobacterial ribosome with MK-7762 revealed the basis for this selectivity. BALB\/c mouse models of disease showed MK-7762 reduced lung bacterial burden by a 3-log-fold decrease in an acute model (N\u2009=\u200918) and a 2-log-fold decrease in chronically infected animals (N\u2009=\u200918). MK-7762 showed lesion penetration similar to linezolid in C3HeB\/FeJ mice. MK-7762 had pharmacokinetic properties predicting low once-daily doses in humans and a favorable 14-day preclinical safety profile in Wistar Han rats (N\u2009=\u200930) and Beagle dogs (N\u2009=\u20096). Four-month safety studies in both rats (N\u2009=\u200920) and dogs (N\u2009=\u200924) showed no changes in hematology parameters at exposures well above the 100-mg predicted human dose. These data will enable MK-7762 to be explored as a component of new tuberculosis treatment combinations for all forms of the disease.","42":"Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) has emerged over the past decade as a valuable three-dimensional bioisostere for benzene, attracting considerable interest in pharmaceutical research for its ability to improve drug-like properties. Although [1.1.1]propellane has traditionally served as the key precursor to mono- and 1,3- disubstituted BCPs, the growing demand for multisubstituted and bridge-functionalized BCP derivatives has spurred the development of alternative, propellane-free synthetic strategies. Recent advances toward these highly strained and sterically hindered ring systems can be broadly organized into three mechanistic categories: intramolecular diradical couplings, carbene-mediated ring expansions, and two-electron disconnections. This Perspective highlights these emerging methodologies, assesses their scope and limitations, and offers an outlook on remaining synthetic challenges and their implications for medicinal chemistry.","43":"Host cell proteins (HCPs) are important process-related impurities produced by the host organism during the manufacturing of biotherapeutics. Even trace amounts of these contaminants can be considered significant during drug development due to their potential impact on the quality, safety, and\/or efficacy of the therapeutic. This article summarizes the findings of a survey conducted by the IQ DruSafe Impurities Safety Working Group (Biologics Impurities Subteam) concerning industry practices and challenges related to HCPs in biologic therapeutics. The survey addressed four key areas: the scope of HCP control challenges, practices for HCP control and monitoring, methods for qualification of HCP levels, and regulatory interactions. Results revealed both perceived risks and experienced impact from HCP impurities as well as analytical strategies for their identification and quantification. The article also presents current default limits being employed for total and individual HCP impurities, approaches for assessing the safety and immunogenicity risk of HCPs, and a summary of feedback from global health authorities. Overall, the survey results illustrate progress in HCP management across biologic drug development while underscoring persistent challenges. The findings point to emerging best practices informed by historical knowledge and also reveal areas where a harmonized approach may be justified. Identifying and addressing challenges will require sustained industry collaboration and ongoing engagement with regulatory authorities to ensure the continued advancement of safe, effective biologic therapeutics.","44":"There is a growing demand for automated organ-on-a-chip platforms that are compatible with off-the-shelf robotic liquid-handling systems and plate readers to improve reproducibility and scalable analysis. In this work, we present an end-to-end automated method for fabricating tubular blood vessel models at scale using a custom 384-well open-top platform (AngioPlate384), designed to support integration with liquid-handling systems and large-scale analysis. Our approach enables the generation of over 100 perfusable blood vessels fully embedded in hydrogel and supported by stromal cells (fibroblasts and pericytes), allowing both luminal and interstitial flow. Using this platform, we demonstrated that stromal co-culture significantly enhances vascular barrier function, and results in an altered response to chemotherapeutics and to inflammatory stressors. This platform offers a robust and scalable approach to generating customizable blood vessel-on-a-chip models for vascular biology studies, disease modeling, and preclinical testing. Its compatibility with automation and standardized workflows positions it as a powerful tool to accelerate the adoption of microphysiological systems in pharmaceutical research.","45":"In drug development, safety assessments must integrate data from heterogeneous sources including clinical trials, non-clinical toxicology, mechanistic evidence, and real-world evidence. At any given timepoint-such as protocol development, dose escalation, interim reviews, or regulatory safety reports-data may be incomplete, or contextually ambiguous. Teams often struggle to summarize the totality of evidence for a given safety topic in a way that is both scientifically rigorous and operationally consistent. There is a lack of a structured, reusable framework that enables critical appraisal and consistent communication of causality reasoning. Consequently, evaluations of safety information are frequently fragmented, logic trails get lost, and key conclusions may become difficult to defend or reproduce, particularly with changes in cross-functional teams or loss of institutional memory. Our framework recognizes and addresses these real-life operational challenges. We propose a structured application of the Bradford Hill Criteria (BHC) [1] that offers a \"plug-and-play\" architecture for organizing evidence from multiple sources consistently. The application of this framework standardizes the interpretation and also allows for the modular integration of new evidence over time. In order to achieve this, we offer a contemporary interpretation of the individual criteria in the context of safety assessments to facilitate their consistent application. Furthermore, teams are guided on mapping of data types-e.g., preclinical findings, spontaneous case reports, PK\/PD data, or RWE-into a reproducible causality narrative that can be iteratively updated across the product lifecycle. Ultimately, this approach facilitates transparent communication of safety evaluations to stakeholders and supports informed decision-making in drug development and post-marketing surveillance. Practically, this structured approach can be used during safety planning [4] at critical milestones, including Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. In early clinical development, uncertainties are inevitable, and evolving safety signals must be evaluated rigorously and transparently in a comprehensive and consistent manner.","46":"To describe comorbidity and comedication burden among people living with HHIV(PLWH) compared with matched people without HIV and evaluate 5-year trends among PLWH from 2020-2024. This retrospective study used administrative claims data (01\/01\/2016-01\/31\/2025) from Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database. The PLWH cohort included adults with \u22651 medical or pharmacy claim for an antiretroviral therapy (ART) agent in 2024 or, for those not treated with ART, an HIV diagnosis code alone (index date: earliest ART or HIV claim). People without HIV were matched 2:1 to PLWH based on age group, sex, race\/ethnicity, region, and insurance type. Baseline characteristics, comorbidity burden, and comedication burden were compared between matched cohorts. 26,078 PLWH and 52,156 matched people without HIV were included (mean age: 59\u2009years). Compared with people without HIV, PLWH had greater baseline Quan-Charlson comorbidity index scores (mean [SD]: 1.24 [1.86] vs. 0.99 [1.85]; <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and greater numbers of comorbid conditions (3.70 [3.63] vs. 3.14 [3.79]; <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and non-ART comedications (9.2 [7.58] vs 7.1 [7.48]; <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001). Multimorbidity (\u22652 comorbidities: 66.4% vs. 53.6%) and polypharmacy (\u22655 non-ART drugs: 68.5% vs. 52.7%) were significantly more prevalent in PLWH (both <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (46.9% vs. 41.2%; <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001), hyperlipidemia (46.0% vs. 34.4%; <i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001), and type 2 diabetes (21.8% vs. 22.1%, <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.393). PLWH have greater comorbidity and comedication burdens than people without HIV. The findings suggest clinicians should consider these factors when choosing ART to minimize drug interactions and adverse events, thereby improving the long-term health of PLWH.","47":"This study detailed the troubleshooting and optimization of a challenging neutralizing antibody (NAb) assay using a previously published PEG precipitation, Acid Dissociation, and Biotin-drug as Assay Drug (PABAD) method to overcome high drug interference. A strong NAb positive control, PC3, showed poor recovery in the PABAD workflow. A PABAD-compatible PC, PC31 was selected among different anti-idiotype antibodies with varied kinetic profiles. A three-tier Design of Experiment (DOE) approach was applied to optimize assay conditions. Centrifugation-based Bluewasher protocols were also established to automate the handling of PEG pellets. The reason for the poor performance of PC3 with the PABAD method was identified, and a sensitive NAb assay was successfully developed using PC31. The poor recovery of PC3 was not due to incompatibility with the PABAD method, but rather to its non-specific interaction with serum factors. Once a specific NAb PC was identified, the NAb assay was successfully developed using PABAD, demonstrating a broad application of the method. DOE-assisted assay development cut the development time by half and meaningfully improved the assay sensitivity. Finally, the implementation of the Bluewasher in the pellet wash further reduced assay variability and enhanced automation of the PABAD method.","48":"Hydrogels, networks of hydrophilic polymers known for their water retention capacity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, are ideal for the sustained and extended delivery of biologics. Because in situ hydrogels can form at the administration site in response to external stimuli, they can provide noninvasive and localized delivery of biotherapeutics. In particular, poloxamer 407 (P407), an \"A-B-A\" triblock copolymer, composed of hydrophilic poly-(ethylene oxide) (block A) and hydrophobic poly-(propylene oxide) (block B), exhibits reversible thermal property: liquid at room temperature and gelling at elevated temperatures. This characteristic, combined with its low toxicity and excellent chemical compatibility, makes P407 an attractive polymer for drug delivery applications. However, its low mechanical strength and weak gel stability have limited its broader use in therapeutic applications. To address this challenge, chemically cross-linked P407 hydrogels were developed using acrylate-modified P407 and thiol-terminated eight-arm polyethylene glycol with two different molecular weights (MWs) via Michael-type addition. Chemical cross-linking enhanced the mechanical strength of P407 hydrogels, enabling extended in vitro release of bovine serum albumin (BSA), human plasma immunoglobulin G antibody (IgG), and adalimumab for up to 70 days with tunable release kinetics profile. Biophysical and functional characterization via circular dichroism, size exclusion chromatography, capillary electrophoresis-sodium dodecyl sulfate, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that the hydrogels did not adversely affect the structural conformation, stability, and in vitro potency of the encapsulated biologics. This study highlights improved P407 hydrogel stability and tunable release profiles by incorporating acrylate reactive cross-linkers with two different MWs, providing insights for the application of sustained and controlled release of biologic.","49":"Recent updates in clinical guidelines and health authority guidance documents have aimed to standardize best practices for assessing renal function; however, it remains unclear whether the pharmaceutical industry has fully adopted these recommendations. This analysis aims to describe the current methodologies used to evaluate the impact of renal impairment (RI) on drug exposure and to inform dosing recommendations for patients with RI, providing insight into current industry practices and identifying potential areas for improvement. A list of new molecular entities (NMEs) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration between 2018 and 2024 was compiled, and the clinical development strategies for assessing the impact of RI on the pharmacokinetics and safety of these NMEs were reviewed. We reviewed 192 NMEs. In dedicated renal impairment studies, renal function was assessed by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in 60 studies, measured GFR in 1 study, and creatinine clearance in 31 studies. We also found that 6 NMEs-5 out of 162 NMEs with non-substantial renal excretion (RE) and 1 out of 30 NMEs with substantial RE required an actionable dosing recommendation for patients with mild RI. In contrast, for severe RI, we found that 47 NMEs-30 out of 162 NMEs with non-substantial RE and 17 out of 30 NMEs with substantial RE required an actionable dosing recommendation. The findings suggest that excluding mild RI patients from phase 2 and 3 studies is not required and highlight that industry must continue efforts to harmonize drug development with clinical guidelines."},"url":{"0":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666253\/","1":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662384\/","2":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41655794\/","3":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41655752\/","4":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41654375\/","5":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41654374\/","6":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41650129\/","7":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41649964\/","8":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41647336\/","9":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41635454\/","10":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41621793\/","11":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41618947\/","12":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41617465\/","13":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41613352\/","14":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41609129\/","15":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41604116\/","16":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41591764\/","17":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41585002\/","18":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41583485\/","19":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41577168\/","20":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41572505\/","21":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41572471\/","22":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41567716\/","23":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41565014\/","24":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41563650\/","25":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41562504\/","26":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41559426\/","27":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41557140\/","28":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41555739\/","29":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41554438\/","30":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41552485\/","31":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41539861\/","32":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41539148\/","33":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41539026\/","34":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41538758\/","35":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41536291\/","36":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41536071\/","37":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41533993\/","38":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41533330\/","39":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41532789\/","40":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41531384\/","41":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41530381\/","42":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41526354\/","43":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41517894\/","44":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41508397\/","45":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41507617\/","46":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41505208\/","47":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41503629\/","48":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41502674\/","49":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41499367\/"}}
