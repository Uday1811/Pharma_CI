Lifestyle medicine (LM) is a burgeoning field that uses therapeutic lifestyle interventions to treat or prevent chronic diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Greater LM practice has previously been shown to predict less burnout among LM practitioners. There is a need to further investigate the relationship between practitioner burnout and using LM to treat patients. This study examines healthcare workers' views to develop a conceptual model to describe how employing LM to treat patients impacts practitioners. This study is a qualitative, thematic analysis of in-depth, semi-structured interviews of forty-two staff members from five health systems in the United States that are implementing LM. Transcripts of in-depth interviews were analyzed for themes related to burnout. Staff interviewed included physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, psychologists, health coaches, and others. Staff described a positive reaction to, and increased job satisfaction following, LM implementation in their healthcare systems. Identified factors that might reduce healthcare worker burnout include meaningful patient improvement, increased patient empowerment, enhanced patient satisfaction, providers' heightened joy\/job satisfaction, providers' belief that LM is how medicine should be practiced, and pride and gratitude due to their organization's support of LM. These factors are related to the three elements of burnout - exhaustion, detachment, reduced feelings of professional efficacy - in a conceptual model. Implementing LM in healthcare systems can potentially reduce burnout in practitioners who believe that LM is an enjoyable and effective discipline. It may do this by creating work circumstances and patient outcomes leading providers to report greater professional joy, an improved sense of professional meaningfulness, and a strengthened conviction of being an effective healthcare worker.","1":"No abstract available","2":"Williams syndrome is a rare genetic condition frequently associated with cardiovascular anomalies, particularly supravalvular aortic stenosis. The coexistence of supravalvular aortic stenosis, aneurysmal dilation, and infective endocarditis with vegetations in the aortic arch is exceedingly rare. We describe an 8-year-old Arab boy from Syria with Williams syndrome who presented with fatigue, tachycardia, dyspnea, fever, chills, and night sweats. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated aortic arch with large vegetation at the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk and supravalvular aortic stenosis. Despite 10 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy, vegetations persisted, necessitating urgent surgery. The ascending aorta was replaced using the McGoon technique with complete excision of infected tissue. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and follow-up imaging showed good left ventricular function without aortic gradient. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and timely surgical intervention in preventing catastrophic outcomes in patients with Williams syndrome and complex cardiovascular involvement.","3":"Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, manifesting as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. While physical activity is known to prevent ASCVD, the exact biological mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the causal relationship between exercise and ASCVD. Participants from the NHANES database (2007-2018) were selected, excluding individuals under 20 years or with missing data. Initial analyses included student t-tests and chi-square tests, followed by constructing a baseline table. Three multivariate Generalized Linear Models (GLM) regression models were used to assess the correlation between exercise and ASCVD. Risk stratification analysis and a smooth curve described the nonlinear association between exercise and ASCVD. Mendelian randomization (MR) was further performed using five methods, with the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method being the primary approach. Sensitivity analysis and Steiger tests were conducted to evaluate the reliability and directionality of the MR results. After applying exclusion criteria, 2179 subjects were included in the analysis. Baseline characteristics showed significant differences in age, cholesterol, glucose, HDL, LDL, hypertension, diabetes, and exercise between ASCVD and control groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Regression analysis revealed a significant association between physical inactivity and ASCVD. Further, risk stratification analysis identified significant influences of exercise, age, race, hypertension, and smoking on ASCVD risk. The smooth curve analysis indicated a nonlinear relationship between exercise and ASCVD risk. MR analysis established causality, with physical inactivity associated with increased ASCVD risk (OR\u2009 1.618, 95% CI\u2009 1.052-2.488, p\u2009=\u20090.029). Sensitivity analysis and Steiger tests confirmed the reliability and directionality of MR results. Physical inactivity causally increases ASCVD risk. Clinically, structured, individualized exercise programs should be integrated into ASCVD prevention and management to complement pharmacotherapy and improve outcomes.","4":"No abstract available","5":"Ethnically diverse populations can present variations in cardiovascular risk, which can be influenced by differences in lipid profiles and other cardiovascular risk factors. This study aimed to evaluate lipid profiles and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in a Mediterranean population, with a focus on variations by ethnicity and sex. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study using the \"Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care\" (SIDIAP) database, which includes primary care data from Catalonia, Spain, collected between 2015 and 2019. The study included subjects aged 40 to 89 years with no prior history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or lipid-lowering therapy. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare lipid profiles and traditional risk factors across ethnic groups and sex. We included 806,458 participants, 56.8% women, 89.9% from Southern Europe, 5.3% from Latin America and Caribbean origin, 3% from North Africa, 0.8% from Central\/South Africa and 1% from Asia. Asian individuals presented the most atherogenic lipid profile, with the lower HDL-C, higher triglyceride levels, and elevated atherogenic indices. Higher LDL-C values were observed in Latin American men and Southern European women. Among the groups studied, Central and South Africans presented the most favorable lipid profiles, with low triglyceride and atherogenic indices, regardless of sex. North Africans and Latin Americans presented higher obesity rates, whilst southern Europeans presented the highest prevalence rates of hypertension and smoking. Individuals from Asia have worse lipid and metabolic profile compared with Central and South African individuals, regardless of sex. Current risk assessment tools may underestimate the cardiovascular risk in these specific populations.","6":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk, and subclinical vascular damage can be evaluated using carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and arterial stiffness measures such as pulse wave velocity (PWV). Sortilin and sclerostin have been proposed as cardiometabolic biomarkers, but their value in identifying early cardiovascular risk in PCOS remains unclear. To compare serum sortilin and sclerostin levels and subclinical vascular markers (CIMT and PWV) between women with PCOS and controls, and to evaluate whether these biomarkers are independently associated with CIMT. In this case-control study, women with PCOS and age-matched controls were assessed for clinical and metabolic variables. Serum sortilin and sclerostin concentrations were measured, and CIMT and PWV were obtained using standardized protocols. Between-group comparisons were performed, and multivariable linear regression models were constructed with CIMT as the dependent variable. CIMT was significantly higher in women with PCOS compared with controls, whereas PWV did not differ significantly between groups. Circulating sortilin and sclerostin levels were comparable between groups and were not independently associated with CIMT after multivariable adjustment. CIMT appears to be a more sensitive marker of early subclinical atherosclerosis in young women with PCOS than circulating sortilin or sclerostin. These biomarkers cannot currently be recommended for early cardiovascular risk assessment in PCOS. Larger, phenotype-stratified and longitudinal studies are needed to clarify their potential prognostic relevance in specific subgroups.","7":"Tuvusertib is an investigational, orally administered inhibitor of ATR protein kinase, currently in Phase II clinical development. Here, we present an integrated nonclinical and clinical assessment of the effect of tuvusertib on QTc interval. In\u00a0vitro inhibition by tuvusertib of the hERG potassium channel was evaluated, and in\u00a0vivo ECG assessments evaluated the effect on QTc in dogs. PK-matched triplicate ECGs in patients receiving tuvusertib in Part A1 of the Phase I DDRiver Solid Tumors 301 study (N\u2009=\u200955; dosing regimens: 5-270\u2009mg QD, 180-220\u2009mg QD 2\u2009weeks on\/1\u2009week off, or 150\u2009mg BID 4\u2009days on\/3\u2009days off) contributed to concentration-QTc analyses via linear mixed-effects modeling. In\u00a0vitro, tuvusertib inhibited hERG with an IC<sub>50<\/sub> of 2.83\u2009\u03bcM, which is ~2.5 times its steady-state unbound C<sub>max<\/sub> at the clinical RDE (180\u2009mg QD 2\u2009weeks on\/1\u2009week off). In\u00a0vivo, tuvusertib did not affect QTc up to 5\u2009mg\/kg\/day in dogs (unbound C<sub>max<\/sub> comparable to that at clinical RDE). In patients with advanced solid tumors receiving tuvusertib at up to threefold higher plasma concentrations than at the RDE, the risk for clinically relevant QTc prolongation was assessed to be low (upper limit of 90% CI of model-predicted \u0394QTcF <\u200920\u2009ms). There was no relationship between tuvusertib plasma concentration and RR interval, suggesting no effect on HR. Early integrated concentration-QTc assessments of tuvusertib monotherapy in Phase I were crucial in informing the low risk for clinically relevant QTc prolongation, thereby facilitating efficient evaluation of investigational tuvusertib combination strategies in ongoing clinical development.","8":"Aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular condition, with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) emerging as the preferred treatment for Stanford type B aortic dissection. TEVAR facilitates thrombosis of the false lumen and remodeling of the true lumen by sealing the initial entry tear. While distal re-entry tears are often left untreated, which can result in the formation and progression of distal aneurysms. Current surgical techniques for managing distal aneurysms each possess distinct advantages and limitations, while their complex anatomical characteristics present significant challenges for clinical application. This article aims to examine the applicability, benefits, drawbacks, and challenges associated with various methods for managing distal aneurysms following aortic dissection, along with corresponding strategies, to provide valuable insights for clinical practice.","9":"Primary care clinicians (PCCs) are tasked with communicating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk to adults who are parents, including Black individuals. The impact of these discussions with parents is especially important because of the potential translation of lifestyle behaviors to their children. However, sparse research has examined Black parent's preferences on whether and how their PCCs should discuss parent's personal CVD risk and associated lifestyle behaviors. This study aimed to understand Black parent's perception of the role PCCs should play in communicating CVD risk and examined their preferences regarding how to communicate risk. Qualitative focus groups (n\u2009=\u200910) were conducted with Medicaid-enrolled Black parents who have a school-aged child (6-11\u00a0years). Parents were recruited from primary care clinics affiliated with an academic medical center and community organizations in central Ohio. Focus group discussion questions were developed using two theoretical frameworks, including the Health Belief Model, to assess parent's desire and preferred approach to discussing CVD risk with their PCC. Focus groups were analyzed using thematic analysis to determine communication preferences. Forty-four parents (n\u2009=\u200940 female; median age 32 [range 24- 57] years) participated in the focus group discussions. Six major themes were identified including: 1) The desire to change health behaviors can be triggered by the recognition of risk factors, which can be highlighted by PCCs; 2) PCCs facilitate lifestyle behavior change by working with patients to develop a plan; and 3) Early communication about CVD risk factors is desired and expected, to prevent the onset of CVD. Other themes discussed the importance of the PCC-patient relationship along with facilitators and barriers to change. Medicaid-enrolled Black parents indicated their desire for PCCs to discuss their personal CVD risk factors with them. This study highlights the importance of patient-provider communication when discussing CVD risk and risk factors.","10":"Anthropometric and body composition indices are associated with subclinical arterial damage (SAD) in populations with overweight and obesity, but limited data exist in populations with chronic inflammatory diseases (CID). Herein we tested the hypothesis that the associations of anthropometric and body composition indices with macro- and microcirculation SAD markers differ in patients with CID compared to non-CID subjects. A total of 264 patients with CID (23.1% men, mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation: 51.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.9 years) and 491 CID-free individuals with cardiovascular disease risk factors (55.8% men, mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation: 51.9\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6 years) were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and retinal vessel calibers were assessed in all participants. In non-CID individuals, all anthropometric indices were positively associated with IMT; most of them were positively associated with central retinal venular equivalent and inversely associated with central retinal arteriolar equivalent and arteriolar to venular ratio. In patients with CID, only body fat percentage [B\u2009=\u20090.002 95% CI (0.000, 0.004)], mid-upper arm circumference [B\u2009=\u20090.007 95% CI (0.002, 0.011)] and waist circumference [B\u2009=\u20090.001 95% CI (0.000, 0.003)] were positively associated with IMT, whereas none of the indices were associated with retinal microcirculation. No associations with PWV were observed in both groups. Body weight, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio were not associated with SAD markers in patients with CID. This may have an impact on the clinical use of these indices in the presence of CID, which needs to be elucidated by future studies.","11":"Depressive and anxiety symptoms are common comorbidities in patients with depression, but their associations with blood pressure (BP) have not been well characterized in treatment-na\u00efve patients. The objective of this cross-sectional investigation was to examine potential associations among depressive symptoms (HAMD-17), anxiety symptoms (HAMA), and blood pressure in first-episode, treatment-na\u00efve (FETN) patients with depression. A total of 1,718 FETN patients with depression participated in this cross-sectional investigation. Depressive symptoms were evaluated through the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), while anxiety symptoms were evaluated via the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA). Both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) served as outcome variables. Multiple linear regression analyses were used for evaluate the relationships among HAMD, HAMA, as well as blood pressure, adjusting to control for demographic characteristics and clinical variables. Participants' average age measured 34.87\u2009\u00b1\u200912.43 years, and 65.77% were] female. Mean HAMD-17 and HAMA scores were 30.30\u2009\u00b1\u20092.94 and 20.80\u2009\u00b1\u20093.47, respectively. Mean SBP and DBP were 119.48\u2009\u00b1\u200910.91 mmHg and 75.95\u2009\u00b1\u20096.74 mmHg, respectively. In the fully adjusted model including both variables simultaneously, HAMD-17 remained significantly correlated with both SBP (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.80, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.98, p\u2009<\u20090.001) as well as DBP (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.36, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.49, p\u2009<\u20090.001). HAMA showed no significant association regarding SBP (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.13, 95% CI: -\u20090.02, 0.28, p\u2009=\u20090.079) while remained significantly associated for DBP (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.15, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.26, p\u2009=\u20090.006). Among FETN patients presenting depression, depressive symptoms were independently correlated with SBP as well as DBP, while anxiety symptoms demonstrated a significant association only with DBP. These findings suggest that depressive and anxiety symptoms may have distinct associations with cardiovascular parameters in patients with depression.","12":"Insulin is an important endocrine peptide hormone with pleiotropic effects on metabolic regulation and cellular growth. Insulin resistance (IR), characterized by insensitivity of metabolic tissues to insulin stimulation, has emerged as a major impediment to overall metabolic health. Triggered by multiple environmental factors and genetic predisposition, IR paves the way for several related diseases, including metabolic associated diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Of note, the liver plays a central role in whole-body metabolism and is the portal encountering high concentrations of insulin. Excess glucose, lipids and the compensatory hyperinsulinemia resulting from IR may collectively impose a huge burden on the liver, driving the progression of chronic liver diseases and fostering a pro-carcinogenic environment by increasing mutagenic susceptibility and angiogenic dysregulation. Better understanding of this mechanistic link is important to highlight the underestimated role of IR in progressive diseases and may contribute to stratified diagnosis and treatment. This review summarizes the risk factors and molecular mechanisms of IR, with a specific focus on its role in carcinogenesis, taking hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as an example. Finally, we discuss the effective lifestyle and pharmacological interventions for IR and emphasize the necessity of incorporating IR management into the prevention, stratified diagnosis and treatment of HCC.","13":"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) are approved to treat IBD, but there are concerns over whether they increase the risk of MACE or venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with IBD. We aimed to compare the incidence risk of MACE and VTE in patients with IBD treated with JAKi agents versus anti-TNFs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database to identify patients \u2009\u2265\u200918\u00a0years with IBD and treated with JAKi or anti-TNF therapy. Patients in the JAKi cohort were matched with patients treated with anti-TNF by using 1:1 propensity score matching. Patients with a history of a prior cardiovascular event were excluded from the analysis. Co-primary outcomes were MACE and VTE within 1-year after medication initiation. Additional subgroup analyses were performed based on age, sex, and IBD type. Kaplan-Meier analysis with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were used to compare time-to-event rates. In total, there were 8942 patients in the JAKi cohort matched with 8942 patients in the anti-TNF cohort. There was no difference between the two cohorts in the development of MACE (aHR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.87-1.33; p\u2009=\u20090.49) or VTE (aHR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.84-1.36; p\u2009=\u20090.61). In patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years, there was no statistically significant difference between the two cohorts in MACE outcomes (aHR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.69-1.31; p\u2009=\u20090.75). Consistent findings were observed when comparing ulcerative colitis to Crohn's disease, upadacitinib to tofacitinib, or JAKi to infliximab. Our results suggest that patients with IBD, including patients\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years, who are treated with JAKi, were not at increased risk of MACE or VTE over a 12-month period as compared to those treated with anti-TNF therapy. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.","14":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) risk is influenced by sex hormones and steatotic liver disease (SLD), but their interplay in women remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the impact of various SLD statuses on AF risk among premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Total 2,181,691 women from the 2009 Korean National Health Insurance Service screenings were analyzed, excluding those with prior AF, hysterectomy, liver cancer, or transplantation. Participants were classified by menopausal status and SLD type: No SLD, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), MASLD with combined etiologies, MASLD and increased alcohol intake (MetALD), and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Over 8.3 years of follow-up, postmenopausal women (n\u2009=\u2009903,079) were older with higher body mass index and comorbidities, while premenopausal women (n\u2009=\u20091,278,613) more often smoked and consumed alcohol. In premenopausal women, AF incidence ranged from 0.65 per 1,000 person-years without SLD to 1.67 in ALD, with the highest hazard ratio in ALD (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.27-3.67). Postmenopausal women showed higher absolute AF incidence (3.43-5.44) but attenuated hazard ratios, peaking at 1.66 in ALD. SLD is significantly associated with increased AF risk, peaking in premenopausal women with MASLD or ALD; these findings necessitate early cardiovascular risk assessment and AF screening, warranting further research into preventive strategies. These novel findings establish a significant association between SLD and increased AF risk across all menopausal stages, demonstrating that the highest relative risk is disproportionately concentrated in premenopausal women with MASLD or ALD, thus underscoring the urgent need for enhanced cardiovascular surveillance and status-specific primary prevention strategies in this overlooked younger population.","15":"The occurrence and development of a wide range of preeclampsia (PE), especially early-onset preeclampsia (EOPE), is closely associated with the immune system. The objective of this research is to utilize machine learning techniques to discover key immune biomarkers and evaluate their predictive potential. We sourced mRNA expression profiles from the GSE60438\u2009+\u2009GSE75010 dataset in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and retrieved immune-related genes from the ImmPort database. Subsequently, we selected immune genes associated with EOPE and late-onset preeclampsia (LOPE) for differential expression analysis. We then carried out Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses on different immune-related genes (DIRGs). Protein\u2012protein interaction (PPI) networks were employed to investigate the relationships among various DIRGs. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multiple support vector machine recursive feature elimination (mSVM-RFE) analyses, we identified candidate biomarkers for EOPE. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic capability of the candidate genes, and a nomogram was constructed to evaluate the performance of the predictive models. To further validate our findings, we analyzed additional GEO datasets (GSE22526\u2009+\u2009GSE74341\u2009+\u2009GSE190639*) and performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on placental tissue to confirm the expression levels and diagnostic values of key genes. Eventually, we utilized the CIBERSORT algorithm to analyze the compositional patterns of the infiltration of 22 immune cell types in EOPE. A total of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 7 DIRGs (HLA-DPA1, FPR1, CGB5, LYZ, LEP, PROK2, and SERPINA3) were discovered through a comparison between LOPE and EOPE. Upon conducting GO analyses, it was determined that DIRGs showed significant enrichment in positive regulation of T cell, lymphocyte, and mononuclear cell proliferation. The KEGG enrichment analysis predominantly demonstrated associations with Immune disease, Endocrine and metabolic disease, and Cardiovascular disease. We identified HLA-DPA1, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II gene involved in antigen presentation and immune regulation, as a potential diagnostic biomarker for EOPE, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.758. Its downregulation in EOPE suggests a potential role in impaired maternal-fetal immune tolerance. Clinical sample analysis revealed that decreased expression levels of HLA-DPA1 were associated with EOPE. Moreover, immune microenvironment analysis indicated that the expression of HLA-DPA1 exhibited a negative correlation with regulatory T cells and Dendritic cells activated, a positive correlation with macrophages M1 and Mast cells resting. Immunity is a key factor in the pathogenesis of placenta in EOPE. HLA-DPA1 can be identified as a key immune gene associated with immune cells, and these findings provide novel perspectives for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of EOPE.","16":"The transition from advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) to kidney failure requires comprehensive management to optimize patient outcomes. This crucial period, in practical terms defined by CKD stages G4 and G5, involves complex decision-making regarding kidney replacement therapy, pre-emptive kidney transplantation and conservative kidney management. Patient preferences, quality of life, and comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease, are essential considerations when making treatment decisions. Importantly, nephroprotective therapies should be continued even at advanced stages of CKD to stabilize kidney function and prevent cardiovascular events. Pre-emptive kidney transplantation, when feasible, offers the best outcomes and should be prioritized. Dialysis initiation should be based on clinical symptoms and shared decision-making with the patient, rather than laboratory values alone. For some, particularly older, patients with substantial comorbidities, conservative kidney management, emphasizing symptom management without kidney replacement therapy, might be preferred. Considerable disparities in access to care exist globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries, highlighting the need for tailored strategies. Registry and cohort studies have provided most of the scientific understanding in this area, but more randomized clinical trials are needed to guide advanced CKD management.","17":"Diabetes remains a major public health challenge, contributing to complications such as kidney disease, cardiovascular disorders, and diabetic retinopathy. Early detection is essential for timely intervention, yet prediction from structured biomedical data is often hindered by limited sample size and feature diversity. This study investigates a deep learning framework that combines tabular-to-image transformation, pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance diabetes prediction. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, numerical features were transformed into 2D image representations based on correlation patterns and feature importance scores. Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks generated additional synthetic samples for training. Feature extraction was performed with DenseNet201, ResNet152, Xception, and EfficientNetB4, followed by classification using LSTM networks optimised via Bayesian search. In five-fold cross-validation, the deep learning pipeline achieved 94% accuracy and 98% AUC on the augmented PIMA dataset, showing improved performance compared to commonly reported benchmarks; however, these results may partially reflect the influence of synthetic data. When evaluated on the Frankfurt Diabetes Dataset, the model exhibited comparable performance, although the limited number of samples indicates that additional studies are required to firmly establish its generalizability. The proposed framework demonstrates promising performance for diabetes prediction from structured data. While the results suggest potential applicability to broader biomedical classification tasks, further validation on large, demographically diverse, and multi-institutional datasets is essential before considering any clinical translation.","18":"Antarctic krill oil (KO) is a richsource of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Endogenous PUFA-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) have garnered attention due to their beneficial effects on body, especially the cardiovascular system. This study integrated non-targeted and targeted lipidomics to investigate KO's time-dependent effects on the comprehensive lipid profile and SPMs in rats. After 1- and 6-week supplementation, KO significantly altered lipid profiles, reducing arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4)-containing lipids while elevating eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5)\/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6)-containing lipids. Targeted analysis identified and quantified 33 PUFA-derived oxylipins, including derivatives of ARA, 8 derivatives of EPA, and 13 derivatives of DHA. Notably, KO consumption substantially decreased pro-inflammatory oxylipins like LTB<sub>4<\/sub>, PGE<sub>2<\/sub>, and TXB<sub>2<\/sub>, while increasing anti-inflammatory LXA<sub>4<\/sub> and SPMs such as RvE1, RvE2, RvD1, RvD4, and MaR1. Long-term intake amplified SPM accumulation, suggesting temporal regulation. These findings elucidate KO's potential mechanism in inflammation management through lipidome remodeling, supporting its application in functional foods for metabolic health enhancement.","19":"This study aimed to examine the association of the level of nurse and general practitioner (GP) interprofessional care on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in patients aged 60 years or more with T2D. This cohort study was conducted between January 2002 and December 2018 in the public primary health care of Vantaa, Finland. An index was created to measure the level of interprofessional care. Mortality was measured with standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Analyzed causes of death included cardiovascular diseases, dementia, digestive system diseases, cancer and respiratory diseases. 11 020 patients were followed for 71 598 person years. Mean follow-up time was 7.3 years. The group with slightly nurse-centred care had the lowest mortality (SMR 0.92, 95\u202f% CI 0.87 - 0.97) and the group with the most GP-centred care had the highest mortality (SMR 2.69: 95\u202f% CI 2.27 - 3.19). Cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death in all groups followed by cancer and dementia varying in rank. Slightly nurse-centred interprofessional care might reduce mortality in patients with T2D. Common causes of death in general population were prevalent in patients with T2D.","20":"High-quality, culturally safe, secondary prevention care has the potential to improve the cardiovascular health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People in Australia (hereafter collectively referred to as First NationsPeoples). Despite this, there is a paucity of comprehensive data on cardiac rehabilitation (CR) participation among First Nations Peoples. The Queensland Cardiac Outcome Registry is a clinical registry that routinely collects point-of-care CR data. Therefore, the aim of this study is to (i) describe the First Nations populations referred to CR across Queensland, (ii) quantify rates of participation, and (iii) determine factors associated with CR attendance and completion. The cohort comprised 2,383 patients who identified as Aboriginal and\/or Torres Strait Islander and were referred to one of 56 Queensland CR service extracted from Queensland Cardiac Outcome Registry (2020-2022). Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with CR attendance and completion. Over the study period, 50% (n=1,185) of First Nations patients in Queensland participated in at least one CR session. Of those who attended, 28% (n=333) completed CR (14% of the total cohort). The strongest predictors of CR attendance were having a coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervention procedure, living regionally (as opposed to remotely\/very remotely), and coming from areas of higher socio-economic advantage. CR completion was more likely among men, those in older age groups (particularly 55-64 years), living in a major city, and non-smokers. This study provides the first known large-scale analysis of the uptake of CR programs among First Nations cardiac patients in Australia. We demonstrate that rates of attendance are higher among this cohort than previously reported. Barriers to attendance are described and highlight an important socio-economic gradient. There are clear opportunities for improving access to evidence-based secondary prevention programs for First Nations Peoples and benefits in collectively considering how unmet needs can be supported.","21":"No abstract available","22":"Ongericimab, a novel proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibody, has recently been approved in China for hypercholesterolemia management but remains unapproved by major global regulatory agencies. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides the first pooled evidence on its efficacy and safety in participants with high cholesterol level. To evaluate the efficacy of ongericimab to reduce lipid levels compared with placebo, assess its effects on other atherogenic and antiatherogenic lipid parameters, and determine its safety profile in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive search of databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from start to July 2025 identified RCTs comparing ongericimab with placebo. Primary outcome was percentage change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Secondary outcomes included changes in other lipid parameters and safety endpoints. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, with heterogeneity assessed via the I\u00b2 statistic. Four double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs (n = 736) conducted in China were included. Ongericimab produced a profound reduction in LDL-C (mean difference: -68.74%; 95% CI, -72.22% to -65.26; I\u00b2 = 0%) and significantly lowered total cholesterol, apolipoprotein (Apo) B, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a), with the latter showing a robust -54.66% reduction after sensitivity analysis. HDL-C (+10.87%) and ApoA1 (+8.12%) were modestly increased. Safety analyses showed no significant differences in rates of upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, hyperuricemia, hepatic enzyme elevations, cardiovascular events, or severe adverse events compared with placebo. Only injection site erythema was significantly higher (odds ratios: 5.57; P = .02), though events were mild and transient. Ongericimab is a potent lipid-lowering agent with a favorable short-term safety profile, offering potential for patients requiring intensive LDL-C reduction. While findings are consistent and clinically compelling, they are derived solely from short-duration trials in Chinese populations and are limited to surrogate endpoints. Large, multiethnic cardiovascular outcomes trials are essential to confirm long-term benefits, assess rare adverse events, and establish its position among global lipid-lowering strategies.","23":"Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) is caused by pathogenic variants in <i>LDLR<\/i>, <i>APOB<\/i>, <i>APOE<\/i> or <i>PCSK9<\/i>, leading to elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and increased cardiovascular risk. In the UK, HeFH affects ~1 in 288 individuals. The 100\u2009000 Genomes Project (100KGP) generated whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from >85\u2009000 participants recruited primarily with cancer or rare inherited disorders. We analysed WGS data to assess the prevalence and spectrum of FH-causing variants. Variants in <i>LDLR<\/i>, <i>APOB<\/i>, <i>APOE<\/i> and <i>PCSK9<\/i> were extracted from 100KGP WGS data and annotated using expert-reviewed ClinGen curation. Demographic, ancestry and linked health records were incorporated. Analyses were restricted to unrelated individuals. Among 54\u2009818 unrelated participants, 167 were heterozygote for an FH-causing variant, giving a prevalence of 1:328 (95% CI 1:285 to 1:386). Prevalence was similar across ancestries, including African (1:388) and South Asian (1:276). Variant distribution was: <i>LDLR<\/i> 67%, <i>APOB<\/i> 26.5%, <i>APOE<\/i> 3.5% and <i>PCSK9<\/i> 3%. Two individuals carried two FH variants, consistent with homozygous FH. Among 22\u2009442 genetic relatives, 77 also carried an FH variant. Of all variant carriers, 53% were female, mean age at recruitment was 41.3 years, with 43 younger than 18 years, and 54.3% had documented hypercholesterolaemia. The prevalence and gene distribution of FH-causing variants in 100KGP are consistent with UK estimates. Differences in variant spectrum across ancestries were observed; however, FH prevalence was similar. Participants who consented to the return of actionable findings were informed, providing direct clinical benefit from genomic research.","24":"Cardiac involvement is a major complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc), with myocardial fibrosis as a hallmark feature. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is used to detect cardiac involvement. However, the prognostic value of serial CMR monitoring and the effects of immunosuppressive therapy remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the prognostic significance of CMR parameter evolution for long-term cardiovascular outcomes and to evaluate the impact of immunosuppressive treatments on myocardial fibrosis. Patients from a single centre who underwent two CMR scans using the same protocol and equipment were included. CMR parameter evolution was compared using paired t-tests. The effects of treatments and changes in CMR parameters on the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality were analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. 44 patients were included with a median (IQR) follow-up duration of 6.3 (3.1-9.2) years. The median interval between CMR scans was 1.5 (1.0-3.9) years. Seven (16%) patients had diastolic dysfunction, and 16 (36%) patients experienced MACE. Rituximab significantly decreased maximal T1 values (p=0.029), a marker of diffuse myocardial fibrosis linked to an increased risk of all-cause death (p=0.044). A significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (p=0.032) and a lower risk of MACE (p=0.024) were observed in patients treated with methotrexate. Methotrexate was associated with reduced MACE risk, while rituximab decreased maximal T1 value, suggesting a reduction in diffuse myocardial fibrosis. These findings support the prognostic value of CMR monitoring and the potential benefit of immunosuppressive therapy in SSc-related cardiac involvement.","25":"Plasma concentrations of procollagen type-I C-terminal pro-peptide (PICP) and collagen type-I C-terminal telopeptide (CITP) may reflect collagen turnover and systemic fibrosis. We investigated the effect of pirfenidone, an anti-fibrotic agent, on PICP and CITP, and their association with myocardial fibrosis, using cardiovascular magnetic resonance to measure extracellular volume (ECV). In the trial (Pirfenidone in Patients with Heart Failure and Preserved Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction), PICP, CITP and PICP:CITP ratio were measured at baseline and follow-up in patients with ECV\u226527% randomised (n=94) to pirfenidone or placebo, and at baseline only in patients who were not randomised because of ECV<27% (n=13). There was no association between baseline myocardial ECV and baseline log PICP, log CITP and log PICP:CITP ratio (p=0.19, p=0.13, p=0.60, respectively). Treatment with pirfenidone did not alter PICP, but reduced CITP and increased PICP:CITP ratio at 13 and 26 weeks (all p<0.05) but not at 52 weeks. After multivariable adjustment, there was a weak relationship between change in myocardial ECV and change in log PICP (R<sup>2<\/sup> 0.16, p=0.01) and log CITP (R<sup>2<\/sup> 0.12, p=0.04), but not log PICP:CITP ratio (p=0.56). In patients with stable heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, pirfenidone treatment had no sustained effect on plasma levels of PICP and CITP at 52 weeks. Changes in ECV during treatment with pirfenidone are associated with changes in plasma PICP and CITP, suggesting a weak association between changes in collagen volume\/mass and plasma markers of collagen turnover.","26":"Multimorbidity, defined as two or more chronic medical conditions, leads to the use of multiple medicines, including for cardiovascular conditions. This is associated with frailty and an increased risk of medication-related harm. Hospitalised adults have higher rates of multimorbidity and frailty compared with non-hospitalised adults. The aim of this study was to examine the use of medicines for hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation among patients with multimorbidity and frailty, who are generally not well represented in clinical trials. A cross-sectional study was performed of adults aged \u226545 years with inpatient admissions during an 18-month period. Regular medications prescribed at discharge and coding data were obtained from the electronic medical record and hospital datasets. The prevalence of multimorbidity (using coded chronic medical conditions or the RxRisk pharmaceutical comorbidity index), frailty (using hospital frailty risk score) and polypharmacy (defined as \u22655 medicines) were calculated. The uptake of medicines recommended by the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines for patients with coded hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation was also assessed. Two large acute care, teaching hospitals in Adelaide, South Australia. 23\u2009980 unique patients were identified. 69% (n=16\u2009637) of patients had multimorbidity using the coding definition compared with 94% (n=22\u2009620) using the pharmaceutical comorbidity score. 81% (n=19\u2009366) had polypharmacy and 46% (n=11\u2009091) had frailty. More than 85% of patients with hypertension were taking an antihypertensive. More than 75% of patients with ischaemic heart disease were taking an antithrombotic or a lipid-lowering agent and more than 50% were taking an agent acting on the renin-angiotensin system. Over 70% of patients with atrial fibrillation without a contraindication to anticoagulation were taking an anticoagulant. Patients with multimorbidity were 11-51%\u2009more likely to be taking an antihypertensive, antithrombotic or lipid-lowering medicine for the respective cardiovascular conditions, whereas those with frailty were 31-48%\u2009less likely to be taking guideline-directed medicines for all conditions studied. Over two-thirds of hospitalised patients with these cardiovascular conditions were taking at least one guideline-directed medicine. Medication use was generally more common in multimorbidity and less common in frailty. Outcomes studies are needed to quantify the risks and benefits of cardiovascular medicines in these patients.","27":"To evaluate emergency patient care from a chronophysiological perspective, examining circadian variations in symptom presentations and physiological parameters.Single-centre retrospective analysis. SETTING: Department of Emergency Medicine, Clinical Centre, University of P\u00e9cs, Hungary (August 2022 to August 2023). Patient data including symptom categories, time of presentation (divided into eight 3-hour intervals), sex and age were collected. A total of 32\u2009977 patient records were analysed. Symptoms were classified using the <i>International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision<\/i>. For hypertension, random proportionally stratified sampling was performed (n=120). Primary outcomes were the circadian distribution of emergency presentations across 14 symptom categories and their variation by time of day, age and sex. Secondary outcomes included diurnal variation in hypertension-related cases, examining blood pressure, pulse rate, triage time and medication use. Cardiovascular cases peaked between 09:00 and 12:00 (p<0.001), toxicological emergencies between 18:00 and 21:00 (p<0.001) and endocrine-metabolic cases between 12:00 and 15:00 (p<0.001). In hypertensive patients, the lowest systolic pressure occurred between 12:00 and 15:00 (p=0.037). More patients presented on weekdays than weekends (p=0.013). Symptom presentations in emergency care follow distinct circadian patterns, highlighting the influence of biological rhythms on clinical demand. Recognition of these temporal trends may support more effective ED scheduling and resource allocation.","28":"High blood pressure (BP) in obese populations poses significant cardiovascular risks, yet the comparative effectiveness of various weight loss interventions on BP remains unclear. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to assess the comparative effectiveness of weight loss interventions in overweight\/obese adults with prehypertension\/hypertension on BP change and adverse events (AEs). A systematic review and Bayesian NMA of randomised controlled trials of weight loss interventions in overweight\/obese patients with prehypertension\/hypertension will be conducted. PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane library (CENTRAL) and relevant references will be searched up to June 2025. Primary outcomes are changes in systolic and diastolic BP; secondary outcomes include AEs, body weight reduction (kg) and quality of life. Study selection, data extraction and methodological quality assessment using Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 2.0 will be performed by independent two authors. A Bayesian NMA will be conducted using BUGSnet, with surface under the cumulative ranking curve to rank interventions. Subgroup analyses will explore heterogeneity by baseline BP severity, intervention duration and comorbidities, and sensitivity analyses will be performed for robustness of the results by RoB and sample size. Ethical approval is not required for this systematic review as it will involve analysis of data only from previously published studies. The results will be disseminated through presentations at international conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals.

Systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, CINAHL, Epistemonikos and Google Scholar. Cohort studies examining the predictive value of validated and\/or reliable field-based muscular strength tests in relation to long-term health conditions in adults aged \u226518 years. A total of 155 studies were included with 94 included in the meta-analysis. Adults with the highest (vs lowest) handgrip strength levels had a lower risk of multiple long-term health conditions (all p<0.05), including cardiovascular diseases (OR=0.73; 95%\u2009CI 0.67 to 0.80), type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR=0.79; 95%\u2009CI 0.68 to 0.91), musculoskeletal impairment (OR=0.65; 95%\u2009CI 0.56 to 0.76), disability (OR=0.57; 95%\u2009CI 0.47 to 0.70), anxiety (OR=0.79; 95%\u2009CI 0.63 to 0.99), depression (OR=0.70; 95%\u2009CI 0.63 to 0.78), cognitive decline (OR=0.57; 95%\u2009CI 0.44 to 0.75), dementia (OR=0.62; 95%\u2009CI 0.53 to 0.73) and Parkinson's disease (OR=0.53; 95%\u2009CI 0.31 to 0.91). A 5\u2009kg increase in handgrip strength was associated with a lower risk of developing most of these long-term health conditions. In turn, adults with the best (vs worst) performance on the 5-repetition chair-stand test had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR=0.80; 95%\u2009CI 0.72 to 0.88), musculoskeletal impairment (OR=0.52; 95%\u2009CI 0.37 to 0.74), disability (OR=0.58; 95%\u2009CI 0.41 to 0.82), depression (OR=0.63; 95%\u2009CI 0.42 to 0.95), and dementia (OR=0.68; 95%\u2009CI 0.54 to 0.85). Every 1\u2009s decrease was associated with 0.94 lower odds of musculoskeletal impairment. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, indicating limited to moderate confidence in the results. Our findings suggest increased handgrip strength and chair-stand test performance are associated with a lower risk of multiple long-term health conditions among adults. This research underscores the predictive value of simple field-based muscular strength tests which appear to be clinically useful for adults across different age groups and demographic profiles.","31":"To estimate hormone therapy (HT) use among women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and to explore whether HT initiation timing is associated with differential long-term health outcomes. Retrospective cohort study. Population-based using the South Korean National Health Insurance Service database. 105\u2009830 South Korean women from 2005 and 2015. Women with POI with ICD-10 code E283 in the database were compared to a 1:4 propensity score-based matching controls. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for major chronic diseases. The study compared 21\u2009166 women with POI and 84\u2009664 controls. POI was associated with higher risks of major chronic diseases, including thyroid disease, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Within the POI cohort, HT exposure was associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (IRR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76-0.88) and dyslipidaemia (IRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.84-0.91). In the landmark analysis, on-time HT initiation within 1\u2009year was associated with lower risks of thyroid disease (IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62-0.76), T2DM (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.93) and dyslipidaemia (IRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65-0.78) compared with delayed initiation. The current study suggests that an on-time HT initiation strategy within 1\u2009year of POI diagnosis is associated with more favourable long-term cardio metabolic outcomes, supporting the clinical importance of early management in POI.","32":"True resistant hypertension leads to higher rates of target-organ damage, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality compared with general hypertension. Guidelines recommend adding a fourth drug to triple therapy if blood pressure (BP) remains uncontrolled. This Phase 3 trial aimed to demonstrate superior BP reduction with the first full-dose quadruple single-pill combination (SPC) vs triple antihypertensive therapy for uncontrolled BP. QUADRO was a multicentre, Phase 3, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial in resistant hypertension. After an 8-week run-in period on perindopril\/indapamide\/amlodipine, participants were randomized 1:1 to quadruple SPC perindopril\/indapamide\/amlodipine\/bisoprolol or continued the same triple therapy for 8 weeks. Efficacy assessments included office systolic BP (SBP) at Week 8 (primary outcome) and 24\u2005h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). The primary analysis examined all randomized patients with uncontrolled SBP; safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This trial is registered under EudraCT No. 2020-004891-16. Overall, 183 patients (quadruple SPC, n = 89; triple therapy, n = 94) were randomized. After 8 weeks, decreases in office SBP [-8\u2005mmHg; 95% confidence interval (CI): -11.99, -4.09; P < .0001] and 24\u2005h-ABPM (-8\u2005mmHg; 95% CI: -10.95, -4.11; P < .0001) were greater with quadruple SPC vs triple therapy. Both treatments were well tolerated; 10 participants (11%) receiving quadruple SPC and 8 (8%) receiving triple therapy had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), and no serious or severe TEAEs were reported. The first full-dose quadruple antihypertensive SPC (perindopril\/indapamide\/amlodipine\/bisoprolol) demonstrated superiority over perindopril\/indapamide\/amlodipine, offering an effective alternative therapy for confirmed resistant hypertension.","33":"The benefits of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) are well established. However, one component, wine, remains controversial. This study assessed the association between MedDiet (with or without wine consumption) and major cardiovascular disease (CVD) or all-cause mortality. The PREDIMED trial included 7447 high-risk participants. Adherence to MedDiet was measured using a validated 14-item questionnaire, including one item on wine (cut-off: seven glasses\/week). The CVD events were recorded over a 4.8-year follow-up, while all-cause mortality was tracked for 17 years. A younger Spanish cohort (the SUN project), including 23,133 participants followed up for 22 years, was also evaluated. In PREDIMED, compared with poor compliers with MedDiet (excluding wine), good compliers (excluding wine), had a multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.84 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-1.15] for CVD. For good compliers with MedDiet (including wine), the HR for CVD was 0.55 (95% CI 0.36-0.83). For all-cause mortality, MedDiet compliers (excluding wine) had HR of 0.77 (95% CI 0.68-0.87), which was 0.67 (95% CI 0.57-0.78) for MedDiet compliers (including wine). In exploratory dose-response analyses, reduced risk for death was not present in PREDIMED participants who drank three or more glasses of wine\/day. Additionally, analyses least vulnerable to threats of abstainer bias were not significant and neither were multiplicative interaction terms for the wine item in the questionnaire. In the SUN cohort, no significant associations were observed between MedDiet compliance, wine, and CVD. However, for all-cause mortality, the HR was 0.94 (95% CI 0.71-1.26) for MedDiet compliers (excluding wine) and 0.54 (95% CI 0.28-1.04) for MedDiet compliers (including wine). When pooling both cohorts, wine consumption within the MedDiet was associated with lower all-cause mortality (P = .01). In PREDIMED, moderate wine consumption, as part of the MedDiet, appeared to be associated with lower mortality and CVD risk. Some non-significant associations and interactions advise caution in interpretation of these findings.","34":"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the primary contractile component of blood vessels and can undergo phenotypic switching from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype in vascular diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and restenosis. This process leads to decreased expression of SMC lineage genes and increased proliferative, migratory and secretory abilities that drive disease progression. Super-enhancers (SE) and lineage-specific transcription factors are believed to drive expression of genes that maintain cell identity and homeostasis. The goal of this study is to identify novel regulators of VSMC homeostasis by screening for SE-regulated transcription factors in arterial tissues. We characterized human artery SEs by analyzing the enhancer histone mark H3K27ac ChIP-seq data of multiple arterial tissues. We unexpectedly discovered the transcription factor PRDM16, a GWAS-identified CAD risk gene with previously well-documented roles in brown adipocytes but with an unknown function in vascular disease progression, is enriched with artery-specific SEs. Further analysis of public bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets, as well as qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis, demonstrated that PRDM16 is highly expressed in arterial tissues and in contractile VSMCs but not in visceral SMCs, and down-regulated in phenotypically modulated VSMCs. To explore the function of Prdm16 in vivo, we generated both inducible and constitutive Prdm16 SMC-specific knockout mice and performed bulk RNA-Seq analysis of aortic tissues and left carotid artery ligation to assess neointima formation. SMC-deficiency of Prdm16 does not affect the aortic morphology at baseline but significantly alters expression of many genes involved in VSMC homeostasis and cardiovascular disease, and suppresses VSMC proliferation and neointima formation in male mice. Specifically, Prdm16 negatively regulates the expression of Tgfb2 that encodes an upstream ligand of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, by suppressing its promoter activity. Our results suggest that the CAD risk gene PRDM16 is highly expressed in VSMCs and is a novel regulator of VSMC homeostasis and neointima formation.","35":"To determine whether incidental radiation dose to pulmonary vein (PV) substructures---known arrhythmogenic sites---was associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). We conducted a retrospective analysis of 209 ESCC patients treated with nCRT. PV substructures (LSPV, LIPV, RSPV, RIPV) were contoured on radiotherapy planning scans, and dose-volume histogram parameters were extracted. AF events were ascertained through systematic cardiac monitoring. Multivariate competing risk regression was employed to assess associations between PV doses and AF, with adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, surgical resection as a time-dependent covariate, and mortality as a competing risk. Among 209 patients (84.9% male; median age 66\u202fyears), the 2-year cumulative incidence of AF was 8.89%, with a median time to AF of 13\u202fmonths. Among the 25 AF events, 15 (60%) occurred after esophagectomy, with a median time from surgery to AF of 2.1\u202fmonths. On univariate analysis, age, hypertension, LIPV-\u223cDmax\u223c, RSPV-\u223cDmax\u223c, and coronary heart disease (CHD) were associated with AF. In the multivariable model, LIPV-\u223cDmax remained an independent predictor (adjusted HR = 3.16, 95% CI: 1.19-8.42, p\u202f=\u202f0.021) after adjustment for age (HR = 3.66, p\u202f=\u202f0.009), CHD (HR = 2.59, p\u202f=\u202f0.019), and surgical resection. Patients with LIPV-\u223cDmax\u223c >28.87\u202fGy had a significantly higher AF incidence (12.3%) than those below this threshold (p\u202f=\u202f0.008). Moreover, AF was associated with inferior 2-year recurrence-free survival (36.9% vs. 78.6%, p\u202f=\u202f0.0051) and inferior 2-year overall survival (58.3% vs. 82.1%, p\u202f=\u202f0.012). Maximum dose to the LIPV was independently associated with increased AF risk and worse survival outcomes in ESCC patients receiving nCRT. These results highlighted the potential value of LIPV-sparing radiotherapy techniques and enhanced AF surveillance in this population. External validation in larger prospective cohorts was needed before firm clinical guidelines can be established.","36":"No abstract available","37":"Altitudinal gradients drive divergent thermal adaptations in ectotherms, but the integrated behavioral-physiological mechanisms underlying such specialization remain unclear. We tested adaptive strategies in two congeneric lizards: high-altitude Phrynocephalus erythrurus (4500-5300\u202fm) and low-altitude desert-dwelling P. przewalskii (1000-1700\u202fm). Hypothesizing cold tolerance in the former and heat avoidance in the latter, we combined field thermal profiling and laboratory assays to quantify key thermal traits. Results showed P. erythrurus occupies a colder habitat with shorter activity windows, exhibiting a lower critical thermal minimum (CT\u2098\u1d62\u2099\u202f=\u202f-0.20\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.58\u202f\u00b0C) and upper escape temperature (UET\u2090) for cold adaptation. P. przewalskii displayed a larger high-temperature thermal safety margin (TSMwarm\u202f=\u202f4.40\u202f\u00b0C) and greater ambient-body temperature difference at escape (\u0394UET), reflecting specialized heat avoidance. Behaviorally, P. erythrurus relied on microhabitat selection for precise thermoregulation, while P. przewalskii used frequent shuttling. Both warmed faster than cooled, with a novel finding of heart rate hysteresis-cardiovascular performance depends on thermal change sequence, not absolute temperature. This study reveals divergent evolutionary pathways (cold endurance vs. heat avoidance) shaped by altitude, providing a mechanistic framework for predicting species-specific vulnerabilities to climate change. Our findings advance understanding of ectotherm adaptive radiation and inform conservation strategies amid global warming, highlighting that low-altitude species face imminent thermal safety margin compression while high-altitude specialists confront unprecedented heat extremes.","38":"Abundant evidence has correlated influenza infection with cardiovascular disease, yet mechanisms linking infection with the heart remain poorly understood. Here, we show that influenza infection damaged the human and murine heart. In mice, we showed that shortly after pulmonary infection, the virus infected a circulating myeloid pro-dendritic cell 3 (pro-DC3) that expressed high concentrations of the chemokine receptor CCR2. The heart, which produces abundant CCL2, preferentially attracted infected pro-DC3. In the myocardium, the virus escaped pro-DC3, infected cardiomyocytes, and triggered production of type-I interferon (IFN-I). Engagement of the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1) on cardiomyocytes caused tissue damage and compromised heart function. Genetically and therapeutically dampening IFNAR1 exclusively in cardiomyocytes protected the heart while preserving anti-viral immunity in the lung. Our results identify a series of host-pathogen interactions that propagate tissue damage and uncover an axis for intervention to mitigate cardiovascular risk following viral infection.","39":"Pectus excavatum (PEX) is the most common congenital chest wall deformity, characterized by posterior depression of the sternum and lower costal margin. While often asymptomatic, severe PEX can lead to compression of the heart and great vessels, potentially causing right ventricular dysfunction, syncope, and other cardiovascular symptoms. Syncope due to right ventricle compression in PEX is rare but can significantly impact quality of life and may require surgical intervention. An 18-year-old female presented to the emergency department after an unwitnessed syncopal episode. The patient reported feeling lightheaded while showering, followed by collapse and brief loss of consciousness. Diagnostic testing revealed normal neurological and metabolic parameters including point-of-care glucose, electrocardiogram, serum troponin, electrolytes, and head computed tomography. Chest imaging showed severe PEX with concerns of right ventricular compression. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated normal cardiac function, and exercise stress testing showed no ischemic changes. Additional laboratory studies revealed iron deficiency anemia. This case underscores the potential for PEX to cause distorted cardiac morphology, including right ventricular compression, which can lead to syncope in severe cases. The absence of cardiac ischemia, arrhythmias, or metabolic derangement suggests postural changes compounded by undiagnosed anemia and underlying PEX as the most likely cause of this patient's syncope. Given the patient's symptoms and anatomical findings, referral for surgical evaluation was made to discuss definitive management options. This case highlights the importance of considering structural chest wall abnormalities in the differential diagnosis of syncopal events, particularly when standard causes are excluded.","40":"Coronary flow meter is commonly used in myocardial revascularization surgery since it allows an intraoperative assessment of blood flow through the different bypasses performed, ensuring an optimal result of the surgery. However, in cardiovascular surgery, the measurement of intraoperative arterial flows could be applied in other types of surgery other than coronary surgery. We present the case of a 68 years-old female patient diagnosed with Standford type A dissection who underwent urgent surgery, replacing the ascending aorta and aortic arch with an Evita Open Neo\u00ae prosthesis with direct reimplantation of the supra-aortic trunks using the Frozen Elephant Trunk technique. Once the prosthesis was implanted, hemostasis was achieved by reinforcing the end-to-end subclavian artery-prosthesis anastomosis with a circumferential pericardial patch, followed by a decrease in blood pressure observed in the monitorization of the radial artery of the left arm. In this situation, blood flow in the left subclavian artery was measured before and beyond the anastomosis, finding a significant decrease. Given the results of the measurement, the patch wad removed from the anastomosis and a second flow measurement was performed, verifying adequate flow distal from the anastomosis and recovery of blood pressure values in invasive monitoring.","41":"Although the broad outlines of a healthy diet are clear, controversy has arisen surrounding certain foods and nutrients. This review updates contemporary nutrition controversies and the extent to which they may promote or protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this review, beef tallow, ultraprocessed foods, full-fat dairy, seed oils, medium chain triglyceride oils, seafood, and alternative sweeteners are considered. Three groupings included: 1) evidence of harm with a recommendation to limit or avoid; 2) lacking in evidence for harm or benefit; and 3) evidence of benefit. The evidence of harm category included beef tallow, due to association with increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, ultraprocessed foods associated with worsened cardiometabolic health, and artificial sweeteners owing to correlations with increased CVD. Within the category lacking in evidence were full-fat dairy, medium chain triglyceride, monk fruit, and stevia. Finally, evidence of benefit included seed oils and seafood based on improved CVD outcomes.","42":"Pretreatment in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) is controversial. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of pretreatment in a center without daily access to the catheter laboratory (CL). This prospective observational single-center study (June 2021-June 2024) included patients with suspected NSTE-ACS undergoing coronary angiography (CAG). Clinical, biochemical and CL data were registered. Patients were monitored during their hospital stay for bleedings events (BE), ischemic events (IE) and misdiagnosis. 443 consecutive patients with suspected NSTE-ACS were included. Median age was 70.0 years (IQR 60.0-77.0) and 71.8 % were male. 84.0 % were under pretreatment. IE, BE and cardiovascular death were of 5.0 %, 4.1 % and 1.8 %, respectively. IE were more frequent in the non-pretreatment group (10.3 % vs 4.1 %; p = 0.030), whereas there was no significant difference in BE (1.4 % vs 4.6 %; p = 0.216). Myocardial infarction (MI) before CAG and type 4b MI rate were lower in the pretreatment group (1.6 % vs 8.5 %; p < 0.001 and 0.3 % vs 2.8 %; p = 0.016, respectively). After adjusting for covariates, pretreatment was associated with a lower incidence of IE (OR 0.35 95 % CI 0.135-0.928; p = 0.035) whereas it was not associated with BE (OR 3.68 95 % CI 0.427-31.651; p = 0.236). A lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and active malignancy were associated with BE, while chronic ischemic heart disease was associated with IE. Pretreatment was associated with a lower incidence of IE in NSTE-ACS patients with lower rates of MI before CAG and type 4b MI, without a significant increase in BE.","43":"The use of electronic cigarettes has increased significantly. Initially marketed as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes, these devices have sparked growing concerns about their impact on cardiovascular health, particularly in contributing to the rise in hypertension. The objective is to review the available evidence on the effects of electronic cigarettes on blood pressure (BP) and other cardiovascular outcomes. This is a systematic review conducted in accordance with PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines, including observational and randomized clinical trials comparing electronic cigarette users with non-users or traditional cigarette users. Participant demographics, intervention characteristics, device usage duration, and primary outcomes were evaluated. The systematic review analyzed data from seven studies exploring the relationship between electronic cigarette use and hypertension. The findings revealed consistent evidence of adverse effects on BP and other cardiovascular outcomes. The primary outcomes included changes in systolic and diastolic BP, while secondary outcomes focused on other cardiovascular effects such as heart rate. Data synthesis considered study quality, population heterogeneity, and confounding factors like concurrent nicotine use. Contrary to the widespread belief that electronic cigarettes are a healthier alternative to traditional smoking, current evidence suggests significant adverse cardiovascular effects, including an increased risk of hypertension. This finding is critical for public health authorities when formulating guidelines and strategies to regulate nicotine-containing electronic devices.","44":"To review the role of lower-body skeletal muscle non-weight-bearing simple resistance activities (SRAs), soleus push-ups (SPUs), and stretching exercises (SEs) in improving glycemic control and metabolic\/circulatory outcomes in those individuals who cannot do weight-bearing aerobic exercises due to musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory and other reasons. We conducted a narrative review of randomized controlled trials, prospective cohorts, and pilot interventions identified through searches of PubMed\/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and ScienceDirect. We examined non-weight-bearing SRAs, SPUs, and SEs, focusing on pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical outcomes. Moderate lower-body strength is associated with 32-35% lower type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.94). Interrupting prolonged sitting with 3-min SRAs every 30\u00a0min reduces insulin response by 26%. SPUs-sustained, seated plantarflexion contractions-reduce postprandial glucose by 39-52% and insulin response by 60% during oral glucose tolerance tests. Passive SE for 40\u00a0min acutely lowered blood glucose by 24-28\u00a0mg\/dL, chronically improves femoral blood flow by 30% and flow-mediated dilation by 25%. Benefits are likely mediated through AMPK-dependent GLUT4 translocation, myokine secretion, and improved endothelial function. Lower-body SRAs, SPUs, and SEs are simple interventions that can be performed while seated and have the potential to significantly improve glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity, and vascular function in populations unable to engage in traditional weight-bearing aerobic exercise. Integration into clinical practice could provide cost-effective tools for the prevention and management of T2D. Finally, the effects of these exercises should be evaluated in long-term studies to determine their impact on glycaemic control and cardiovascular protection.","45":"Acute stress, in moderation, helps to prepare the body to overcome mental and physical challenges. However, excessive bouts of acute stress can be detrimental to the cardiovascular system and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and sudden cardiac death. Transcutaneous median nerve stimulation (tMNS) is a promising therapy for the mitigation of acute stress through peripheral neuromodulation, but the optimal delivery of tMNS for stress mitigation may require continuous monitoring of acute stress events for targeted delivery. The purpose of this study was to develop a wearable system capable of continuous closed-loop acute stress monitoring and mitigation through non-invasive cardiovascular sensing and tMNS respectively. A wearable wrist-worn device capable of sensing three channels of photoplethysmogram (PPG) and tri-axial accelerometry was designed. Pulse rate (PR) and PPG amplitude (PPGamp) were extracted from the acquired green PPG signal, while tMNS was delivered at varying intensities by custom-designed analog circuitry onboard the device. A companion app was used to wirelessly set stimulation levels by communicating with the device's microcontroller using Bluetooth low energy. The device was validated against bench-top sensors in a study with 19 healthy participants involving acute mental and physical stressors as well as tMNS. Repeated-measures correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were performed to compare PR extracted from 9904 5-s windows of PPG from the device and heart rate (HR) extracted beat-by-beat from bench-top electrocardiogram (ECG) and averaged across the same windows. Statistical tests were also performed to analyze differences in mean PR and PPGamp from baseline metrics across the acute stress and tMNS protocol. PR extracted from our device correlated (r\u202f=\u202f0.871, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and agreed (mean difference: 0.51 bpm, 95\u202f% limits of agreement: 6.58 bpm, 5.57 bpm) strongly with HR extracted from bench-top ECG. We found decreases in mean PPGamp from baseline during stressors, while application of tMNS alongside stressors increased PPGamp back to baseline levels, and continued delivery of tMNS post-stressor further increased PPGamp to a significant difference from baseline. Significant reductions in PR as compared to baseline post-physical stressor also mirrored these findings, suggesting that our wearable device can track elevations in acute stress through cardiovascular monitoring while also mitigating the effects of acute stress through tMNS. Our device is the first wearable, to our knowledge, to enable continuous monitoring of acute stress through cardiovascular sensing and feature extraction while mitigating acute stress through peripheral neuromodulation. Future work should test the device in ambulatory settings and investigate potential applications for clinical use-cases such as anxiety or trauma disorders.","46":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is a public health issue in low- and middle-income countries. Identification of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (SCA) might contribute to the prevention of life-threating cardiovascular events. This study aimed to describe SCA prevalence in adults from the southern Caribbean. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted with 653 adults ages 18-80 years old. Participants provided sociodemographic and medical history, including cardiometabolic and respiratory health data, and underwent fasting blood tests and ultrasound imaging to assess carotid atherosclerosis. The prevalence of SCA was 29.5%. Subjects with SCA were 15.6 years older (P <0.001), had less education (P <0.001), and had lower socioeconomic levels (P <0.001) than those without SCA. Smoking was more frequent among subjects with SCA compared with non-SCA adults. Age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.01, P <0.0001), weight (OR: 1.002, P = 0.02), and income (OR: 0.99, P = 0.005) were associated with SCA prevalence. Current smoking was associated with higher frequency of atherosclerotic plaque (OR: 1.05, P = 0.042). In conclusion, SCA was highly prevalent among adults from the southern Caribbean. These findings might contribute to identifying vulnerable groups to CVD living in low- and middle-income settings.","47":"No abstract available","48":"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is the age-related presence of expanded somatic clones secondary to leukemogenic driver mutations and is associated with cardiovascular (CV) disease and mortality. We sought to evaluate relationships between CHIP with cardiometabolic diseases and incident outcomes in high-risk individuals. CHIP genotyping was performed in 8469 individuals referred for cardiac catheterization at Duke University (CATHGEN study) to identify variants present at a variant allele fraction (VAF) \u22652%. Associations were tested among any CHIP variant, large CHIP clones (VAF\u2009>\u200910%) and individual CHIP genes with prevalent cardiometabolic traits. Cox proportional hazard models tested CHIP associations with time-to-overall mortality and Fine-Gray analyses tested CHIP associations with incident cardiovascular outcomes. We identified 463 CHIP variants in 427 individuals (5.0%) of which 268 (3.2%) harbored large CHIP clones. CHIP and large CHIP were associated with lower odds of obesity (OR 0.79 [95% CI 0.65-0.98], p\u2009=\u20090.03; OR 0.76 [95% CI 0.57-0.99], p\u2009=\u20090.04, respectively). CHIP was associated with prevalent heart failure (HF, OR 1.25 [95% CI 1.01-1.55], p\u2009=\u20090.04; especially for non-DNMT3A CHIP (OR 1.38 [95% CI 1.04-1.82], p\u2009=\u20090.02). CHIP was also associated with incident events: Non-DNMT3A CHIP was associated with increased risk of time-to-HF hospitalization (HR 1.29 [95% CI 1.02-1.63], p\u2009=\u20090.03). In high-risk individuals referred for cardiac catheterization, large CHIP and non-DNTM3A CHIP were associated with obesity, prevalent HF, incident CV events. These findings strengthen the importance of CHIP as a biomarker for CV disease and highlight the contributing risk of large CHIP clones and non-DNMT3A CHIP variants.","49":"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is experiencing an epidemiological transition where non-communicable diseases are becoming the leading cause of disability and mortality alongside infectious diseases such as HIV\/AIDs. Multimorbidity, the coexistence of two or more long-term conditions, is increasing in SSA. However, the cost of managing multimorbidity is largely unknown. This study aimed to estimate the economic cost of public outpatient primary care for adults with multimorbidity (HIV, hypertension, and\/or diabetes, and their associated conditions, cardiovascular disease and TB) in rural South Africa. This study used a cross-sectional, retrospective cost-of-illness approach to estimate the direct and indirect costs of multimorbidity management in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, in 2022. Data was synthesized from patient-level data from eight public primary healthcare facilities within the Agincourt study site - a rapidly transitioning rural South African setting. Additionally, government reports and an existing study on transport costs and productivity losses conducted within the Agincourt study site were used to estimate the costs of managing patients in the primary care facilities. Results showed that patients with multimorbidity had higher average economic costs per patient compared to those with single conditions. Overall, patients with multimorbidity increase costs above the baseline of a patient with a single condition (R4 900\/annum) by between 42% - 83%. Patients with multimorbidity also incur slightly higher costs associated with accessing primary care services compared to those with a single condition. However, our model shows that the additive cost of managing multiple conditions in separate consultations is higher than managing all conditions in a one visit. This shows that managing patients within an integrated care model seems to have a cost-limiting effect. However, treatment guidelines for managing multimorbidity in South Africa should be developed to ensure standardised care.","50":"Evaluating pulmonary circulation parameters (PCP) with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a relatively new approach with the potential for complex evaluation of the cardio-pulmonary system. Its impact might complement clinical assessment through right heart catheterization (RHC), the gold standard in evaluating pulmonary hypertension (PH) and hemodynamics, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The study aims to examine the correlation between PCP and diastolic and systolic function, as well as PH, in patients with recent-onset dilated cardiomyopathy (RODCM). Eighty-four patients with RODCM were retrospectively included. All patients had a CMR examination, RHC (including pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)), and TTE. The pulmonary transit time (PTT), corrected pulmonary transit time (PTTc), systolic and diastolic function, and PH were assessed. Patients were divided into groups according to the PH and the diastolic function. PTT and PTTc correlated with PCWP, cardiac index, PVR, and E\/e'. Patients with a restrictive filling pattern showed significantly longer PTT. The receiver operating characteristic curves for PTT, PTTc, and PH were assessed with areas under the curve of 72.7% for PTT and 75.3% for PTTc, and cut-off values of 8.62\u2009s (PTT) and 8.52\u2009s (PTTc). To our knowledge, this is the first study focused on CMR-derived PCP in an RODCM group. Our findings show that PTT and PTTc are prolonged in patients with impaired systolic and diastolic function, and PH. Therefore, PCP might offer critical information to evaluate the cardio-pulmonary system comprehensively.","51":"Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), defined as blood pressure of \u2265140\/<90\u2009mmHg, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications yet few estimates of prevalence are recorded globally. Data on blood pressure measurements of adult Filipinos were taken as one of the variables in the National Nutrition Survey; however, the prevalence of ISH and its associated risk factors has not been investigated. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with ISH among middle-aged (40-59 years) and older (60 and above) Filipinos. A secondary data analysis of the cross-sectional survey design of the 2018, 2019, and 2021 Expanded National Nutrition Survey (ENNS) of the Department of Science and Technology-Food and Nutrition Research Institute (DOST-FNRI) was utilized in the study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the factors significantly associated with ISH. The prevalence of ISH from the pooled data was 9.10% (95% CI: 8.68\u25009.53) and increased significantly with age. After adjustment, multivariable analysis identified several factors significantly associated with ISH, the factors included: age, with those 70 years old of age or older exhibiting the highest odds [AOR 11.71 (95% CI: 8.38\u250016.35)], having little to no formal education [AOR 1.39 (95% CI: 1.18\u25001.64)], the presence of diabetes [AOR 1.62 (95% CI: 1.38\u25001.90)], or prediabetic [AOR 1.37 (95\u2009CI: 1.13\u25001.66)], a family history of hypertension [AOR 2.26 (95% CI: 2.03\u25002.52)], and current alcohol drinker [AOR 1.24 (95% CI: 1.08\u25001.43)]. ISH was prevalent among middle-aged and older Filipino population across the three survey periods. Given the impact of ISH on cardiovascular outcomes, these findings may provide crucial data on its prevalence and determinants, which can assist policymakers in formulating targeted interventions centered on lifestyle modifications.","52":"Background Youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and severe obesity face high risk of diabetic kidney disease, which metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) can mitigate. This study explores structural and molecular changes in kidneys after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), a form of MBS. Methods Paired analyses, including metabolic profiling, kidney volume assessment, histological evaluation, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on kidney biopsies from five youth with T2D and obesity pre- and 12 months post-VSG in the IMPROVE-T2D (Impact of Metabolic surgery on Pancreatic, Renal and cardiOVascular hEalth in youth with T2D) cohort. Circulating proteomics with kidney transcriptomics, were linked using data from an independent cohort of youth with obesity, with or without T2D, undergoing MBS in Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS, n=64). Results Post-VSG, participants lost weight and had improvements in insulin sensitivity and metabolic parameters. Kidney changes included reduced renal hyperfiltration, total kidney volume, mesangial matrix area, and microalbuminuria. scRNAseq in proximal tubule (PT) and thick ascending limb cells indicated repression of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and tricarboxylic acid cycle genes, with upregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3). Decreased metabolic signaling aligned with reduced ribosomal phosphorylated S6K (pS6K), suggesting attenuated mTORC1 activity. JAK-STAT pathway activation in PT was diminished, correlating with lower circulating ligands from Teen-LABS proteomic data. Conclusion MBS\/VSG prompts kidney molecular adaptations, providing potential targets for non-surgical interventions against obesity- and diabetes-associated kidney disease.","53":"GLP-1RAs are increasingly prescribed to older adults with type 2 diabetes for their metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, but their effects on bone health in this high-risk population are not well established. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of fragility fractures associated with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) therapy compared to sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in older adults with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a population-based retrospective new-user cohort study using the nationwide Clalit Health Services database. Participants included people with type 2 diabetes aged 65 years or older who initiated GLP-1RA therapy or comparator drugs during 2018-2022. The primary outcome was first fragility fracture. Follow-up continued until fracture occurrence, death, or 31 March 2024. An intention-to-treat approach was used. Baseline characteristics were balanced using inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity scores. Hazard ratios were estimated using multivariate survival analysis accounting for the competing risk of death. The study included 46,177 participants: 11,257 GLP-1RA users and 34,920 comparator drug users. During a median follow-up of 34.7 months, 4,086 (8.8%) individuals experienced a fragility fracture and 4,595 (10.0%) died. In the propensity score-weighted model adjusted for baseline characteristics and competing risk of death new users of GLP-1RAs had an 11% increased fracture risk compared to the comparator group (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.21). Initiating GLP-1RA therapy was associated with a modestly increased risk of fragility fractures in older adults with type 2 diabetes. These findings may inform clinical decisions by balancing clinical benefits against potential skeletal risks in this vulnerable population.","54":"The cardiovascular and renal benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are well established among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, comparative evidence regarding cancer risk remains limited. We compared the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC), two malignancies with rising incidence and poor prognosis, in patients with T2D initiating SGLT2i vs GLP-1 RA. A new-user comparative cohort study with a target trial emulation framework was conducted using the TriNetX database from June 1, 2014, to May 31, 2024. We included adults with T2D who initiated SGLT2i and those who initiated GLP-1 RA. Patients were matched 1:1 using propensity scores based on age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors, medical utilization, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory measurements. Outcomes were incident RCC and UCC, analyzed with Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression. There were 294\u2009664 patients in each group after matching, with 278\u2009760 female individuals (47.3%), a mean age of 59.3 years, 377\u2009312 White individuals (64.0%), 117\u2009542 African American or Black individuals (20.0%), and 29\u2009750 Asian individuals (5.1%). Over a mean follow-up of 44.2 months, SGLT2i use was associated with a lower incidence of RCC (1.07\u00a0vs 1.26 per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.92) and UCC (0.89\u00a0vs 1.05 per 1000 patient-years; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.92) than GLP-1 RA use. Subgroup analyses stratified by demographics and comorbidities showed consistent results. Based on the established cardiorenal benefits of both agents, our findings provide comparative safety and cancer risk data warranting further investigation.","55":"Arsenic is a prevalent and significant cause of poisoning worldwide, leading to both acute and chronic toxicity. The life-threatening nature of arsenic toxicity is evident in its link to fatal health conditions in different parts and systems of the body. We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the existing literature on long-term health outcomes following arsenic poisoning during infancy. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases from their inception up to May 2025. The final selection included seven studies that met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 15,701 participants. A risk assessment of arsenic exposure through powdered milk was done, and a quality assessment was performed. Seven studies were included. Arsenic poisoning due to contaminated milk powder has many effects on multiple organs. This review synthesizes evidence demonstrating that arsenic poisoning during infancy is associated with increased all-cause mortality, primarily attributable to malignancies, neurological disorders, and persistent alterations in somatic development. Exposed individuals exhibited reduced adult height, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations, and an increased incidence of malignancy. Dental sequelae comprised enamel hypoplasia and gingivitis; dermatological manifestations included persistent punctate hypomelanosis and other cutaneous abnormalities enduring decades. This systematic review delineates the multifaceted long-term health consequences of infantile arsenic poisoning from contaminated milk powder, encompassing malignancies, genitourinary, respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. These findings establish arsenic exposure during critical developmental windows as a lifelong health determinant that requires specialized, multidisciplinary medical surveillance protocols. Regulatory standards for arsenic in infant nutrition products need to be reevaluated to prevent similar tragedies from occurring.","56":"No abstract available","57":"Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are severe cerebrovascular disorders lacking effective gene therapy or pharmacological interventions. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence has been associated with various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases; however, its role in IA pathogenesis remains unexplored, and the key regulatory genes remain unidentified. By integrating multi-omics data, machine learning, and experimental validation, we identified two senescence-associated genes (SAGs) that may serve as VSMC senescence biomarkers in IAs. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data from a mouse elastase-induced IA model (GSE193533) with human bulk RNA sequencing and microarray datasets to investigate VSMC senescence in IA. Our analyses included cell clustering, cell-cell communication, differential expression, functional enrichment, pseudotime trajectory inference, and high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA). Machine learning identified candidate SAGs, which were validated using external datasets and immunohistochemical analysis of human IA tissues. Single-cell analysis of the mouse IA model revealed 26 clusters across 10 cell types, with IA samples showing VSMC depletion, immune cell enrichment, and fibroblast expansion. VSMCs were categorized into five subsets (VSMC1-5), with the extracellular matrix remodeling and synthetic-inflammatory subtype (VSMC1) significantly increased. Differential expression analysis of VSMCs intersecting with senescence-associated genes from the Aging Atlas database identified 159 SAGs enriched in inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Integrating hdWGCNA and bulk transcriptomics identified 45 key SAGs. TGFB1 and SERPINE1 emerged as robust biomarkers of senescence-associated VSMCs, showing high diagnostic accuracy (AUC\u2009>\u20090.75) and upregulation in IA tissues. Our study provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of intracranial aneurysms. VSMC senescence may contribute to IA progression. TGFB1 and SERPINE1 may serve as biomarkers and promising therapeutic targets for VSMC senescence in IA. However, their specific mechanisms require further investigation and validation.","58":"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of cancer and immune disorders. However, their cardiotoxicity, particularly the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), raises growing concerns. We aimed to comprehensively examine the associations between TKIs and AF using real-world pharmacovigilance data. We conducted a case-control study by analyzing adverse event (AE) reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System between 2004 and 2023 for 56 FDA-approved TKIs. AF cases were identified using the preferred term \"atrial fibrillation\". Patient characteristics were compared between fatal and non-fatal cases. Disproportionality analysis, quantified using the reporting odds ratio (ROR), was employed to assess the associations between TKIs and AF. Among 561,551 TKI-related AE reports, 3794 (0.7%) involved AF. The majority of AF events (89.7%) were classified as serious, with 11.3% associated with fatal outcomes. Significant differences in gender, age, drug categories, and systems involved in the indication were observed between fatal and non-fatal outcome groups (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Disproportionality analysis identified 12 TKIs significantly associated with AF. Notably, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors showed the strongest signals, with ibrutinib (ROR: 9.83; 95% CI: 9.34-10.34) leading, followed by zanubrutinib (ROR: 6.29; 95% CI: 3.70-10.69) and acalabrutinib (ROR: 5.58; 95% CI: 4.38-7.11). Additionally, nine other TKIs, including nilotinib, ponatinib, and nintedanib, among others, were associated with increased reporting frequencies. These findings suggest that certain TKIs are associated with an elevated risk of AF, underscoring the importance of vigilant cardiovascular monitoring during TKI therapy.","59":"The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a surrogate marker of insulin resistance (IR) asso-ciated with atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Chronic total occlusion (CTO) presents major clinical challenges, especially in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This narrative review explores the role of the TyG index in predicting CTO development and adverse cardiovascu-lar outcomes. A literature review of studies assessing the association between the TyG index and CTO, PCI outcomes, and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) was conducted. Pathophysiological mechanisms linking IR, TyG, and CTO progression were evaluated, and the predictive utility of the TyG index in risk stratification and post-PCI complica-tions was analyzed. Multiple studies show that a higher TyG index is strongly associated with increased CTO risk, poor collateral circulation, CIN, and adverse outcomes after PCI. Elevated TyG values were independently predictive of impaired collateral formation in diabetic and non-diabetic patients, with stronger effects in metabolically vulnerable subgroups. Individuals with higher TyG levels had a greater likelihood of developing CIN, with analyses confirming its role as an independent predictor. Long-term prognosis in CTO patients was also worse with elevated TyG, with higher rates of major adverse car-diovascular events. The TyG index demonstrated consistent predictive capability com-pared with other metabolic markers, supporting its potential as a low-cost tool for risk stratification. The TyG index is a cost-effective biomarker for predicting adverse out-comes in CTO patients. Its incorporation into clinical assessment may improve early risk identification and support individualized PCI planning.","60":"This study aims to explore the effects of forest therapy on negative emotional states, oxidative stress levels, and the risk of cardiovascular disease among elderly patients with hypertension. A total of 120 eligible elderly hypertensive participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or an intervention group, utilizing a random number table, with each group comprising 60 individuals. The control group engaged in urban walking, while the intervention group underwent forest therapy. Following a 4-week intervention period, comparisons were made between the 2 groups regarding blood pressure, emotional well-being, and oxidative stress levels. Participants were subsequently followed for 12 months to evaluate the incidence of cardiovascular events. After the intervention, both groups exhibited significant reductions in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, with the intervention group showing markedly greater improvements compared to the control group. Furthermore, the intervention group demonstrated a significantly greater increase in superoxide dismutase levels and a more pronounced decrease in malondialdehyde levels than the control group. Assessments of emotional health indicated that the intervention group had significantly lower scores in Tension-Anxiety, Anger-Hostility, Fatigue-Inertia, Depression-Dejection, and Confusion-Bewilderment, while scores for Vigor-Activity were significantly higher. The intervention group also exhibited a significantly reduced risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio = 0.340, P = .018, 95% CI: 0.120-0.950). Forest therapy is an effective intervention for managing blood pressure, enhancing emotional well-being, and reducing oxidative stress levels in elderly hypertensive patients, ultimately contributing to a lower risk of cardiovascular events.","61":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). This study examined patient characteristics, SCI-specific factors, and biochemical parameters associated with CVD risk. A retrospective secondary analysis was conducted on 421 patients admitted between January and December 2017. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were recorded within 7 days of admission. CVD risk was estimated using the QRISK-2 score. Between-group differences were examined using Chi-square and Kruskal - Wallis tests. Logistic regression with multiple imputation was performed to identify predictors of CVD risk. Most patients were male (73%), aged <65 years (74%), and had traumatic SCI (68%). Over half (56%) were at medium\/high CVD risk. Common biochemical abnormalities included vitamin D deficiency\/insufficiency (56%), hypoalbuminemia (46%), anemia (42%), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (48%), low creatinine (55%), overweight\/obesity (49%), high cholesterol (40%), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (43%), and high cholesterol\/HDL ratio (28%). Univariate regression identified higher creatinine (OR 1.02), CRP (OR 1.01), and hypoalbuminemia (OR 0.923) as independent predictors of increased CVD risk, alongside traditional factors (male sex, older age, high total cholesterol, low HDL, elevated cholesterol\/HDL ratio). Multivariate analysis confirmed significant associations of serum albumin (negative) and creatinine (positive) with CVD risk. No significant associations were found with injury level, onset, or nutritional risk scores. Patients with SCI often present at admission with high rates of CVD risk and biochemical abnormalities. A more systematic approach with clear clinical guidance for routine CVD risk assessment at admission is required, alongside tailored early interventions.","62":"Aging reshapes immunity through immunosenescence and inflammaging, increasing susceptibility to infection, exacerbating chronic conditions, and blunting vaccine responses. This review frames \"immunofitness\" as a practical goal of healthy aging and examines how adult vaccination builds immune resilience. Vaccination strengthens adaptive memory, leverages adjuvants to optimize antigen presentation, and can reprogramme innate cells (trained immunity), yielding heterologous benefits beyond target pathogens. We integrate evidence in older adults for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumococcal, COVID-19, and recombinant zoster vaccines, including reductions in respiratory events, cardiovascular outcomes, hospitalization, and mortality. We highlight emerging platforms and precision vaccinology to tailor schedules by immune age, comorbidity, and frailty. Integrating routine, age-appropriate vaccination with lifestyle measures is a feasible, high-impact strategy to promote immunofitness.","63":"Clonal haematopoiesis (CH) has been recognized as an important interface between chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and the heightened cardiovascular risk observed in type 2 diabetes (T2D). CH arises from somatic mutations that give haematopoietic stem cells a competitive advantage and drive the expansion of pro-inflammatory myeloid lineages. These mutant cells exhibit amplified IL-1\u03b2 production, enhanced NLRP3-inflammasome activity, and increased chemokine signalling, thereby accelerating atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and vascular inflammation. At the same time, metabolic disturbances characteristic of T2D promote clonal expansion by weakening normal stem cell fitness and modifying epigenetic regulation. This creates a self-reinforcing loop in which inflammation and metabolic stress sustain CH growth, while CH-derived myeloid cells worsen systemic and tissue-level inflammation. Such interactions may contribute not only to excess coronary disease and heart failure but also to microvascular complications through heightened myelopoiesis, neutrophil activation, and dysfunctional stem-cell mobilisation. This review integrates epidemiological, mechanistic, and experimental findings to present a unified model in which CH and diabetic metabolic stress act synergistically. We explore the shared pathways (niche remodelling, inflammatory memory, and metabolic rewiring) that underpin this bidirectional relationship and discusses how CH may differentially shape cardiometabolic outcomes. Future perspectives in this field are also discussed, including refining CH detection, integrating clone characteristics into risk stratification, and developing targeted therapies that disrupt the metabolic and inflammatory circuits supporting clonal expansion. Anti-inflammatory strategies and metabolic modulators may ultimately provide personalised approaches to reduce CH-associated cardiovascular risk in T2D.","64":"No abstract available","65":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite major advances in pharmacological, devices, and surgical care. Gene editing technologies have introduced a transformative approach to correct pathogenic variants and modulate disease pathways. This review highlights recent progress in editing technologies that are currently or may soon be applied to address cardiovascular disorders, summarizes recent preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrate improved precision and efficacy, and examines technical and translational challenges that must be overcome for broader clinical application. We summarize preclinical advances, including refined target selection, improved delivery strategies, and enhanced therapeutic efficiency. We highlight emerging technologies that aim to overcome longstanding constraints such as limited vector cargo capacity, protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) incompatibility, chromatin accessibility, suboptimal editing efficiency, and off-target activity. We also summarize the increasing clinical experience with in-vivo editing - particularly using lipid nanoparticle (LNP) and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based platforms - that has also revealed important safety considerations, including vector immunogenicity, systemic inflammation, and organ-specific toxicities. Despite rapid progress, successful clinical translation of gene and base editing for CVD continues to hinge on two central challenges: efficient and precise delivery and mitigation of immunogenicity and toxicity from both delivery vectors and gene-editing enzymes. Although next-generation editors and targeted delivery systems have expanded the scope of feasible cardiovascular applications, overcoming these biological barriers remains the critical step toward achieving well tolerated, durable, one-time genomic therapies. Continued innovation in vector engineering, tissue-selective delivery, and immunologic risk mitigation will be essential for advancing editing technologies into cardiovascular care.","66":"While a link between cardiovascular risk factors and increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk has been reported, it remains unclear whether AD pathology has a direct effect on cardiac function and myocardial innervation. AD and amyloidosis are known to impair neuronal function and affect brain neurotrophic factors (NGF and BDNF) expression. Amyloid aggregates and neuro-signaling impairments may also expose AD patients to peripheral nervous system deficits, promoting cardiac disorders. Here, we provide novel understanding of cardiac physiological impairment, amyloid pathology, neurotrophic factors loss, and impoverishment of cardiac neuronal fibers in Tg2576-AD mice hearts, human cardiomyocytes in culture, and human AD post-mortem left ventricular (LV) heart tissue. We reveal that Tg2576 animals exhibit increased myocardial fibrosis, amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition, and brain\/heart-axis neurotrophic deficiencies, resulting in myocardial denervation and cardiac dysfunction. A\u03b2 oligomers challenge reduces BDNF expression in both human immortalized and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, by disrupting TrkB\/CREB signaling. Analysis of human LV AD post-mortem tissue confirms cell and animal results. Our findings reveal potential pathways by which A\u03b2 pathology may disrupt cardiac neurotrophic signaling and physiology, identifying a possible link between AD and heart degeneration.","67":"The aim of this study was to explore the effects of underwater breathing-holding training on the cardiovascular function and swimming performance of athletes. Sixty swimming athletes from sports colleges are separated into an experimental group and a control group, with 30 athletes in each one. Two groups undergo 8 weeks of swimming training with a total of 32 lessons. The control group athletes receive routine swimming training. The experimental group adds breath-holding training during swimming training. Before and after training, cardiopulmonary function tests are conducted on the two groups, including heart rate, lung capacity, blood pressure, and breath-holding time. Meanwhile, the maximum suction pressure, suction flow rate, and maximum ventilation volume of the athletes are tested before and after the experiment. In addition, the study also adds a 50m freestyle swimming test to explore the swimming performance of two groups before and after training. After 8 weeks, the overall improvement effect of the experimental group was more significant. In the cardiopulmonary function test, the lung capacity of the experimental group athletes increased from 3.24\u00b11.69L to 4.81\u00b11.93L, with statistical significance (P<0.05). For the control group, the lung capacity before and after the experiment did not exhibit statistically significant difference (P>0.05). Meanwhile, the heart rate of the experimental group athletes decreased from 58.61\u00b19.32 beats\/minute to 56.39\u00b18.28 beats\/minute, with a P value of only 0.1668, lower than that of the control group's 0.4412. In addition, the breath-holding time of the experimental group increased from 54.36\u00b12.05 s before the experiment to 60.15\u00b13.28 s (P<0.05). In the index tests of maximum suction pressure, suction flow rate, and ventilation volume, the experimental group had statistically significant differences before and after the experiment (P<0.05). The control group only had statistical significance in maximum suction pressure and suction flow rate. In addition, the 50m freestyle swimming time of the experimental group athletes was reduced from 25.52\u00b10.59 s to 25.20\u00b10.66 s (P<0.05). The free swimming performance of the control group before and after training was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The results of lung CT examination showed that the lung function of the experimental group athletes significantly improved. The lung imaging images showed larger lung volume, unobstructed airway, clear alveolar structure, and no obvious lung lesions or atrophy. The combination of breath-holding training and routine training in swimming training can improve the cardiovascular function of athletes, enhance their respiratory function, and ultimately enhance their swimming performance. This training method provides a scientifically effective training strategy for swimmers.","68":"No abstract available","69":"Limited data are available regarding the relative rates, etiology, and long-term prognostic implications of spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery for left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD). MIs after PCI and CABG for LMCAD were adjudicated from the EXCEL trial (Evaluation of Xience Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization). Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to assess the association between spontaneous (and procedural) MI and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality at 5 years. Among 1882 patients who underwent LMCAD revascularization, spontaneous MI during 5-year follow-up occurred in 60 (6.8%) patients after PCI and in 29 (3.4%) patients after CABG (adjusted hazard ratio [adjHR], 2.01; 95 CI, 1.29-3.15; <i>P<\/i>=0.002). By multivariable analysis, spontaneous MI (as a time-adjusted covariate) was a strong independent predictor of subsequent cardiovascular mortality (adjHR, 9.39; 95% CI, 5.22-16.87) and all-cause mortality (adjHR, 4.77; 95% CI, 2.92-7.80) within 5 years, with consistent effects after PCI and CABG (<i>P<\/i><sub>interaction<\/sub>=0.60 and 0.78, respectively). In the same models, procedural MI as defined by extensive myonecrosis was associated with 5-year cardiovascular (adjHR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.64-5.56) and all-cause mortality (adjHR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.48-3.80), with consistent effects after PCI and CABG (<i>P<\/i><sub>interaction<\/sub>=0.23 and 0.34, respectively). In the EXCEL trial, spontaneous MI occurred relatively infrequently within 5 years after LMCAD revascularization but at a higher rate after PCI compared with CABG. Spontaneous MI after revascularization was strongly related to subsequent cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, consistently after PCI and CABG, and was more strongly associated with mortality than was large procedural MI.","70":"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the benign clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells, is often caused by somatic sequence variations in genes associated with hematologic malignancies. Over the past decade, CH has emerged as a risk factor for a wide range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including atherosclerosis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and thrombosis. The cardiovascular risk associated with CH is heterogeneous; it varies on the basis of specific genes and variants, clone size, and various extrinsic features. Mechanistic studies suggest that CH contributes to CVDs through both gene-specific pathways and broader inflammatory processes. These include aberrant cytokine production, inflammasome activation, and other proinflammatory mechanisms, which can accelerate atherosclerosis, promote thrombogenesis, and impair vascular or myocardial function. These findings underscore the importance of addressing CH as a potential contributor to CVDs. CH is predominantly considered an age-related phenomenon, but lifelong influences on the fitness of genetic variants, including germline predispositions, obesity, chronic inflammation, and exposure to environmental toxins (eg, tobacco, certain cancer treatments), influence CH. A greater understanding of CH risk factors is therefore important for both individual and population-level risk assessments. Incorporating CH-associated risk into existing CVD risk prediction models may inform new personalized preventive or therapeutic approaches. No CH-specific therapies have proven efficacy in CVD treatment or prevention, but multiple molecular-based therapeutic hypotheses are beginning to be tested.","71":"Skeletal complications are a pressing concern across prevalent chronic endocrine and cardiovascular conditions. Patient-specific skeletal assessment encompassing bone remodeling dynamics, density, geometry, microarchitecture, and strength are essential for elucidating underlying pathogenesis and informing treatment strategies. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) accurately assesses three-dimensional bone density, geometry, microarchitecture, and strength in vivo. Time-lapse analysis enables noninvasive investigations into dynamic bone remodeling processes by longitudinally tracking voxel-level bone gain and loss. Integrating time-lapse analysis with HR-pQCT ('time-lapse HR-pQCT') provides a comprehensive skeletal assessment - virtual bone biopsy - that is accessible, noninvasive, and reliable. Time-lapse analysis was validated for in vivo skeletal assessment in microCT-based preclinical studies two decades ago. Recently, clinical time-lapse HR-pQCT research has demonstrated its feasibility in assessing bone turnover in patients with chronic kidney disease, and in characterizing spatial mapping of long-term bone gain\/loss in response to bone-targeted drugs, mechanical loading, and disease\/injury. Nevertheless, future challenges remain, including validation against bone biopsy with quantitative histomorphometry, comparisons to established circulating bone turnover biomarkers, and adaptation for pediatric populations. Time-lapse HR-pQCT is a skeletal assessment capable of evaluating and longitudinally monitoring changes in bone remodeling dynamics, density, geometry, microarchitecture, and biomechanics. We advocate for its broader implementation, provided that rigorous validation and ongoing methodological optimization are ensured.","72":"Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a well-established cause of secondary hypertension and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), and severe bilateral disease may precipitate recurrent episodes of acute heart failure, including flash pulmonary edema, particularly in elderly patients with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities. This report highlights the diagnostic approach, therapeutic strategy, and outcomes in a complex patient with multiple comorbidities. A 78-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, asthma, peripheral arterial disease, spherocytosis, and chronic kidney disease, presented with recurrent episodes of acute pulmonary edema (APE) initially attributed to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Transthoracic echocardiography showed grade II diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and mild valvular disease. Coronary catheterization excluded significant obstructive coronary artery disease, whereas renal angiography revealed severe bilateral renal artery stenosis (right: 65%, left: 80%-90%), associated with worsening renal function and refractory hypertension. Given the high-risk clinical phenotype, the patient underwent bilateral renal artery angioplasty with stent placement, following nephroprotective measures due to the elevated risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. The procedure was uneventful with good angiographic results. At one-year follow-up, no further episodes of pulmonary edema occurred, renal function improved, blood pressure was well controlled, and renal arteries remained patent on ultrasound. This case highlights the importance of evaluating renal artery stenosis in patients with sudden or recurrent acute pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension, or progressive renal dysfunction, particularly in the presence of multiple comorbidities. Bilateral renal revascularization was effective in stabilizing renal function and improving blood pressure control; however, long-term follow-up remains essential.","73":"Early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the recommended standard of care for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but long-term outcomes in mixed real-world cohorts remain underreported. This study evaluated the effects of early PCI (\u226424 hours) compared with delayed or no PCI on short- and long-term clinical outcomes. A five-year mixed cohort study was conducted and included\u00a0891 consecutive AMI patients (early PCI, n = 446; delayed\/no PCI, n = 445). Demographics, clinical characteristics, procedural data, and in-hospital outcomes were collected. Long-term outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF) hospitalization, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), were assessed over a median follow-up of 48 months. Propensity score matching and Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for confounding.\u00a0Statistical analyses were done in the IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).\u00a0 Results: Early PCI was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (18\/446, 4.0% vs 35\/445, 7.9%; p = 0.01), shorter door-to-balloon time (median 65 vs 210 minutes; p < 0.001), and better left ventricular function (mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 48.7% vs 46.2%; p < 0.001). Over a median follow-up of 48 months, early PCI significantly reduced all-cause mortality (62\/446, 13.9% vs 112\/445, 25.2%; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.73, p < 0.001), cardiovascular mortality (44\/446, 9.9% vs 82\/445, 18.4%; adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.77, p = 0.001), HF hospitalization (56\/446, 12.6% vs 84\/445, 18.9%; adjusted HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.93, p = 0.02), and MACE (92\/446, 20.6% vs 138\/445, 31.0%; adjusted HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.82, p < 0.001). Recurrent MI was slightly lower with early PCI (38\/446, 8.5% vs 49\/445, 11.0%; adjusted HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52-1.16, p = 0.21) but did not reach statistical significance. Early PCI confers substantial short- and long-term survival benefits in AMI patients, with significant reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, HF hospitalization, and MACE. These findings underscore the critical importance of timely reperfusion, supporting guideline-driven early PCI strategies in real-world practice.","74":"Myocardial infarction (MI) in individuals younger than 45 years is uncommon but carries significant clinical and psychosocial implications. Its presentation challenges traditional assumptions regarding cardiovascular risk and necessitates tailored approaches to diagnosis and management. We conducted a retrospective analysis of five patients aged <45 years admitted to a local hospital in New York with confirmed MI. Data included comorbidities, imaging, laboratory results, angiographic findings, and treatment modalities. Early-onset MI occurred predominantly in males, most of whom exhibited conventional risk factors. Coronary angiography revealed both single- and multi-vessel disease. Follow-up data were incomplete, with two patients lost to follow-up. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing conventional risk factors in younger populations and emphasize the need for individualized long-term management strategies.","75":"The primary goal was to assess the connection between sarcopenic obesity (SO) and progression to advanced cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome in middle-aged and older Chinese adults. Our analysis utilized data collected during the 2011 and 2015 of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). CKM stages were identified based on the AHA criteria adapted for CHARLS. SO was defined with the concurrence of possible sarcopenia and obesity. The relationship between SO and advanced CKM stages was assessed using logistic regression models. In cross-sectional analysis of 8,448 participants, after accounting for potential confounders, individuals with SO showed significantly higher odds of advanced CKM syndrome (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.21-1.88), compared to the normal group. Over an average of 4-year follow-up, 829 of 4,454 individuals with early CKM stages progressed to advanced CKM stages. The fully adjusted model revealed that participants with SO showed a substantially higher risk of CKM syndrome progression compared to normal group (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.34-2.45). In subgroup analyses, SO maintained a positive correlation with advanced CKM stages, especially among men, older adults, smokers, alcohol consumers, and diabetic patients. Sex and age may act as modifiers in the relationship between SO and advanced CKM syndrome (<i>P<\/i> for interaction, 0.03 and <\u20090.001, respectively). Our cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of CHARLS data underscore the significant association between SO and the risk of progression to advanced CKM syndrome. Incorporating SO assessments may facilitate earlier identification and prevention of CKM syndrome progression.

To map short- and long-term survival, stratified by relevant comorbidities and stroke characteristics. Individuals from the United States Veterans Health Administration were included. AIS and PD were defined by validated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, pharmacy data, and encounter type. Covariates included demographics, smoking status, cardiovascular comorbidities, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and frailty. Individuals with PD and stroke were matched 4:1 to controls and survival was measured over 10\u2009years. Two percent of strokes were manually reviewed for size, location, and mechanism per TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria. A total of 3173 cases of PD and AIS were identified and matched to groups of PD-only, stroke-only, and controls (N\u2009=\u200912,692 each). Survival analysis showed PD-only and stroke-only had a predictable increased mortality (added deaths ranged from 1.9 [0.9, 2.9] to 4.7 [2.9, 6.6] per 100 person-years). PD\u2009+\u2009stroke showed further increased mortality with distinct timelines at 0-1-, 1-5-, and 5-10-year periods and synergy accounted for 2.9 [0.5, 5.4] to 19.3 [14.0, 24.6] additional deaths across 10\u2009years. Effects persisted after matching for cardiovascular comorbidities, neurotrauma, and frailty. PD\u2009+\u2009stroke compared with stroke-only had smaller strokes (80.0% vs. 63.2%) and no differences in location, mechanism, or recurrence rates. Patients with PD and AIS had greater than expected mortality that was independent of comorbidities or stroke characteristics. This may reflect widespread structural and functional deficits that may warrant a targeted therapeutic strategy. \u00a9 2026 The Author(s).

This risk is amplified in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), where a pro-inflammatory milieu accelerates atherogenesis. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), key mediators of vascular inflammation, contribute significantly to this process. Icosapent ethyl (IPE), a highly purified ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), reduces major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) beyond triglyceride lowering, yet its cellular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to determine whether IPE modulates inflammatory pathways in patient-derived MDMs and to distinguish direct EPA effects from therapy-mediated changes. This single-centre, open-label, randomised observational cohort study will recruit ASCVD patients, stratified by T2DM status, who are prescribed IPE (Vazkepa\u00ae). MDMs and plasma\/serum samples will be collected from patients, either IPE-na\u00efve or following 6\u2009months of therapy. In parallel, direct EPA effects will be assessed by treating MDMs from healthy donors and ASCVD patients with physiologically relevant concentrations of EPA. We will evaluate NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome priming and activation, inflammatory cytokine profiles, and markers of cellular senescence. The study will investigate mechanisms that potentially underlie the cardiovascular benefits of IPE, focusing on the modulation of inflammatory pathways. We hypothesise that IPE attenuates priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in monocyte-derived macrophages, thereby reducing cellular inflammation and senescence. This study will provide mechanistic insight into how IPE influences macrophage-driven inflammation in ASCVD and T2DM, informing strategies to target residual inflammatory risk in high-risk cardiometabolic populations.","78":"Participation in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) by ethnic minorities is poor, despite evidence supporting its effectiveness. This study evaluated CR participation and completion by South Asian compared to White European service users, and assessed factors associated with non-completion in both groups. The National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation (NACR) data (January 2014 to February 2023) was used to identify South Asian and White European service users referred for CR following myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft. Logistic regression and backwards selection were used to examine differences in participation and completion between groups and identify associated factors. From 421,281 service users eligible for CR (383,833 White European, 37,448 South Asian, 115,812 women, median age 67 years), 222,928 participated (53%), of which 171,297 (77%) completed. After adjustment for age, sex, index of multiple deprivation (IMD) and co-morbidities, South Asian service users were 12% more likely to participate in CR than White Europeans (aOR 1.12, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.15), but 22% less likely to complete (aOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.82). In both groups, strongest associations with non-completion were higher deprivation, diabetes and being single. In White European and South Asian men, stroke and depression were also key factors. Non-completion was also associated with respiratory conditions in White Europeans and with rheumatism and family cardiovascular history in South Asian men. South Asians are more likely to participate but less likely to complete CR than White Europeans. Programmes tailored to individual needs are required to reduce disparities in care.","79":"No abstract available","80":"<p> Arterial hypertension (HTN) is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in Latin America; however, control rates remain inadequate. Two primary contributors to this public health crisis are nonadherence to antihypertensive treatment and clinical inertia. Non-adherence rates in the region range from 14% to 94%, while clinical inertia, defined as healthcare providers' failure to escalate or modify treatment, when necessary, further complicates the issue. The interplay between these two factors creates a self-perpetuating cycle that leads to poorly controlled hypertension, increased morbidity and mortality, and a greater economic burden. A primary concern is \"ineffective adherence\", which occurs when patients follow prescribed treatments but do not achieve desired outcomes. This phenomenon is primarily driven by medical inertia and affects a significant proportion of cases. <\/p> <p> This review examines the scope of these issues in Latin America, their socioeconomic impacts, and potential interventions to mitigate their effects. To better manage hypertension, comprehensive strategies are recommended, including patient-centered interventions, education directed at providers, essential healthcare reforms, and team-based care strategies that involve non-physician providers. <\/p>.","81":"Heart failure (HF) is a critical global health concern, affecting women due to unique biological, epidemiological, and sociocultural factors. Despite accounting for a significant percentage of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among women, HF remains unexplored, particularly in areas such as gender-specific diagnostic challenges and therapeutic strategies. This review explores the intricate pathophysiology of HF, focusing on inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and fibrosis as pivotal contributors to disease progression. Moreover, it highlights advancements in pharmacological treatments, including ARNI, SGLT2 inhibitors, and novel therapeutic agents like vericiguat (for selective patients) and omecamtiv mecarbil (modest benefits), while addressing the potential of lifestyle interventions, such as diet, exercise, in mitigating HF risk. Artificial intelligence emerges as a promising potential for enhancing diagnostic precision, patient management, and outcome prediction, heralding a new era in HF care. By integrating gender-specific research and innovations, this study aims to refine strategies for improving women's cardiac health, ultimately reducing the global burden of HF.","82":"Post-discharge care continuity represents a modifiable factor influencing outcomes in myocardial infarction survivors, yet its multidimensional relationship with treatment adherence and psychological morbidity remains underexplored. This retrospective cohort study analysed 452 adults with first-time acute myocardial infarction discharged between 2019 to 2024 from Beijing Tongren Hospital. Care continuity was quantified via a validated 10-point score (0-10) assessing follow-up frequency (0-4 points), content coverage (0-3 points), and multidisciplinary coordination (0-3 points). Participants were stratified into low (\u2264\u20093 points, n\u2009=\u2009231), moderate (4-6 points, n\u2009=\u2009157), and high continuity (\u2265\u20097 points, n\u2009=\u200964) groups. Primary outcomes were 6-month treatment adherence (composite of medication possession ratio\u2009\u2265\u200980% for \u2265\u20092 core medications and\u2009\u2265\u200975% scheduled visit completion) and anxiety\/depression symptoms (PHQ-9\u2009\u2265\u200910, GAD-7\u2009\u2265\u20098, or clinical diagnosis). Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological confounders. High continuity care demonstrated significantly increased treatment adherence versus low continuity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\u2009=\u20092.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.82-3.42) and reduced anxiety\/depression symptoms (aOR\u2009=\u20090.48, 95% CI: 0.30-0.77). Each 1-point continuity increase improved adherence by 22% (aOR\u2009=\u20091.22, 95% CI: 1.15-1.30) and decreased psychological risk by 13% (aOR\u2009=\u20090.87, 95% CI: 0.82-0.93). Absolute adherence difference between high and low continuity groups was 35.1% (number needed to treat\u2009=\u20093). Cardiovascular events decreased progressively across continuity levels (low: 22.1%, moderate: 12.7%, high: 7.8%; p\u2009=\u20090.003), with high continuity independently reducing event risk by 58% (aOR\u2009=\u20090.42, 95% CI: 0.24-0.73). Urban residence and higher left ventricular ejection fraction predicted better continuity access. Quantified care continuity exhibits a dose-dependent association with superior medication adherence, psychological wellbeing, and reduced cardiovascular risk in myocardial infarction survivors. Optimising continuity represents a high-yield strategy for secondary prevention.","83":"Deaths attributed to stimulants in the United States are largely driven by fentanyl coinvolvement. We sought to compare antecedents of acute stimulant deaths involving fentanyl to those that do not involve opioids. We analyzed data from 31 fentanyl-stimulant and 70 stimulant-no-opioid decedents in a psychological autopsy study in San Francisco, CA. We used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to identify variables potentially associated with coinvolvement of fentanyl in death. We included 36 variables (sociodemographic characteristics, substance use, medical history, and circumstances surrounding death) from medical examiner reports, informant interviews, and medical records. We conducted multivariable logistic regression using variables selected by the LASSO model to assess associations with coinvolvement of fentanyl in death. Past-year fentanyl use and opioid-related emergency department visits in the 3 years before death were associated with higher odds of fentanyl involvement in death [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.16-8.29, P = 0.02 and aOR = 4.62, 95% CI: 1.03-20.66, P = 0.045, respectively]. Having a cardiac condition (from medical history, autopsy, or informant report) was associated with lower odds of fentanyl involvement in death (aOR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03-0.46, P < 0.002). Our findings add to existing evidence that fentanyl-stimulant deaths are markedly different than stimulant-no-opioid deaths. The association of opioid-related emergency department history with fentanyl involvement in death reinforces a potential touch point for overdose prevention efforts (eg, naloxone, medications for opioid use disorder). Our finding of cardiac conditions being associated with lower odds of fentanyl involvement in death supports the hypothesis that stimulant-no-opioid deaths may be driven by cardiovascular conditions.","84":"Assess the possible hematologic and cardiovascular health effects of jet fuels used by the U.S. military. Systematic literature review based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Integrated Risk Information System handbook to evaluate the scientific evidence for hematologic and cardiovascular effects following jet fuel exposure. Human evidence for hematologic and cardiovascular outcomes was indeterminate; the few studies available were considered low confidence or uninformative. Animal toxicological studies provided slight evidence that jet fuel exposure produces effects on the hematologic system but indeterminate evidence for cardiovascular effects. Evidence suggests the hematologic system might be sensitive to jet fuel exposure; however, uncertainty remains due to the limited epidemiologic and mechanistic studies and the minimal changes observed in animal studies. The available evidence is inadequate to assess the possible cardiovascular effects of jet fuels.","85":"First-pass perfusion cardiovascular MR (FPP-CMR) enables the non-invasive diagnosis of microcirculation and coronary artery disease. In free-breathing FPP-CMR, motion correction is usually performed in the image domain, requiring an initial reconstruction. This fact hinders its use in model-based and deep learning reconstructions, which present remarkable performance in obtaining high-quality images from highly accelerated acquisitions. We address this challenge by estimating and correcting respiratory motion in free-breathing FPP-CMR directly in k-space. We propose K-CC-MoCo, an inter-frame rigid motion correction approach formulated exclusively in k-space that handles dynamic contrast through a specifically targeted design of the normalized cross-correlation (CC) objective function to deal with the dynamic contrast. In addition, an ROI-based coil-compression approach was employed to focus the optimization on the heart region. The proposed method was compared to state-of-the-art image-based registration using a digital phantom and real free-breathing acquisitions with different accelerations. The proposed k-space-based method is approximately 2\u00d7 faster and can correct respiratory motion even at high acceleration factors (up to 50\u00d7), where the image-based method fails due to severe undersampling artifacts. Notably, after K-CC-MoCo, the time-averaged images are visibly less blurred. Quantitative metrics (SSIM, etc.) support this conclusion. K-CC-MoCo outperforms image-based correction in free-breathing FPP-CMR acquisitions accelerated up to 50\u00d7. Respiratory motion is estimated and corrected in k-space, enabling its use for model-based and\/or deep learning reconstructions from highly accelerated scans.","86":"Cardiac signaling proteins sensitive to changes in cardiac status may help predict the cardiac effects of doxorubicin in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We determined the relationship between these proteins and biomarkers of cardiac injury and echocardiographic characteristics. Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations were measured in 83 children on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Protocol 95\u2009-\u200901 before, during (T1: 0-50 days, T2: 51-100 days, T3: 151-300 days), and after treatment and compared to existing data for cardiac troponin-T (cTnT), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and echocardiograms. Compared to baseline, mean IL-6 concentrations were lower during doxorubicin treatment (P\u2009<\u20090.01 for all) and after (P\u2009=\u20090.03). Mean NRG-1 and CT-1 concentrations were significantly lower beginning at T2 and thereafter (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for all). Mean VEGF concentrations were significantly elevated from baseline at all on-treatment time points (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.02 for all). Lower odds of abnormal cTnT were marginally associated with increased NRG-1. Higher odds of abnormal NT-proBNP were associated with CT-1 concentrations (P\u2009=\u20090.03) and marginally associated with increased IL-6 and NRG-1 concentrations. Increased hsCRP concentrations were associated with increased IL-6, NRG-1, and CT-1 (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for all). No echocardiographic measurements were associated with signaling proteins. Decreased concentrations CT-1 and NRG-1 during doxorubicin treatment may increase cardiomyocyte death. Changes in IL-6 and VEGF suggest doxorubicin-related inflammation and angiogenesis. These markers may help identify children at greatest risk of long-term adverse outcomes.","87":"Insulin resistance (IR) is associated with a reduced response to insulin and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. The triglyceride glucose index (TyG), triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (Tg\/HDL-c), metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR), and cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and glucose (CHG) index are recognized as useful surrogate IR markers. With the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome and hypertension, we aimed to investigate the relationship between hypertension and IR in a large Iranian population. The individuals are recruited cross-sectionally from the Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorder (MASHAD) cohort study. Hypertension was defined as a blood pressure reading exceeding 140\/90\u00a0mmHg or the use of anti-hypertensive medications. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) analysis, net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement index (IDI) for incremental classification performance, restricted cubic splines (RCS), threshold effect analysis, subgroup analysis, and Poisson regression with robust variance to estimate the prevalence ratios were employed in the statistical evaluation. A total of 9438 adults were analyzed, with 2943 individuals identified as having hypertension. Spearman's correlation coefficients indicated that all four IR indices exhibited a significantly positive correlation with both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. In multivariate analysis, after full adjustment, each 1-unit increase in TyG, Tg\/HDL-c, METS-IR, and CHG index was associated with 23.4%, 8.1%, 52.5%, and 9.9% higher odds of hypertension, respectively. Analysis of the ROC curve indicated that each of the four metabolic indices demonstrated a significant capacity to predict hypertension (all p\u2009<\u20090.001). The METS-IR index showed the highest discriminative performance among the indices, achieving an AUC of 0.642 (95% CI 0.630-0.654). We investigated whether adding IR surrogate indices to the conventional model could improve hypertension detection. The TyG index had the highest incremental classification values (NRI: 13.58%, 95% CI 8.65-18.35; IDI: 0.956, 95% CI 0.834-1.079). RCS analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between TyG, Tg\/HDL-c, and CHG with hypertension, while a linear relationship was observed between METS-IR and hypertension. Threshold effect analysis for the indices with a non-linear relation with hypertension showed that these associations were strongest at lower index values and then flattened, and often losing statistical significance. The findings were consistent across various subgroups, although the effects appeared to be more pronounced in participants who did not have dyslipidemia across all indices. A sensitivity analysis employing Poisson models with robust variance validated the direction and ranking of effects, revealing smaller prevalence ratios compared to odds ratios. Surrogate IR indices were independently associated with hypertension, reflecting underlying metabolic dysfunction linked to blood pressure elevation. These markers may complement traditional assessments by helping to identify individuals with early or latent cardiometabolic risk.","88":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), driven largely by atherogenic dyslipidaemia. Conventional lipid parameters such as total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) do not adequately reflect the complex lipid disturbances that characterize T2DM. Composite lipid-based indices offer inexpensive and integrative measures of cardiovascular risk, but their predictive utility in African populations remains poorly characterized. This study investigated the association between multiple atherogenic indices and 10-year estimated CVD risk in Nigerian adults with T2DM. In this analytical cross-sectional study, 197 adults with T2DM aged 40-74 years without established CVD were included in the final analysis from an endocrinology clinic in Makurdi, Nigeria. Sociodemographic, clinical, and fasting lipid data were collected. Ten-year CVD risk was estimated using the World Health Organization (WHO) risk prediction laboratory-based chart for Western sub-Saharan Africa. Several atherogenic indices were derived, and a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses was used to determine their comparative incremental predictive value beyond traditional risk factors like age, systolic blood pressure, diabetes duration, anti-lipid therapy, and anti-hypertensive therapy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis assessed their discriminatory performance for elevated CVD risk (\u2265\u200910%). Traditional risk factors accounted for 72.4% of the variance in estimated 10-year CVD risk. Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) demonstrated the strongest incremental predictive value, explaining an additional 6.2% of the variance (\u0394R\u00b2 = 0.062, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Other cholesterol-based ratios (CRI-II, CRI-I) added minor, significant value, but triglyceride-centric indices like the Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) did not. However, none of the indices alone demonstrated significant discriminative power in ROC analysis. In this study population, non-HDL-C significantly enhances the prediction of 10-year CVD risk beyond conventional factors, outperforming other cholesterol-based ratios. Triglyceride-centric indices, including AIP, offered no significant incremental value. Therefore, incorporating this low-cost index into existing risk assessment frameworks could strengthen early identification of high-risk individuals in resource-limited settings. Not Applicable.","89":"Although diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), epidemiological studies showed wide variations in the incidence of AMI in people with diabetes and inconsistent time trends. The objectives of the present systematic review were as follows: (i) to analyze the age-sex-adjusted incidence of both non-fatal and fatal AMI in people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes, (ii) to investigate corresponding time trends, and (iii) to identify sex differences. A systematic literature search was performed in the literature databases MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS until July 19, 2023, to identify population-based studies reporting the incidence of AMI in people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes according to our predefined inclusion criteria. In total, 28 population-based cohort studies were included in this review. In women with diabetes, the incidence of AMI ranged from 102 to 690 per 100,000 person-years, and in men with diabetes from 206 to 1630. Estimates comparing people with and without diabetes ranged from 1.55 (95% CI 1.44-1.67) to 14.37 (8.43-24.47) in women and from 1.33 (1.18-1.51) to 4.17 (2.72-6.37) in men. Over the past four decades, the incidence of AMI declined in almost all studies in people without diabetes, but only in half of the studies in people with diabetes. There was considerable heterogeneity with regard to the definition of AMI, the population with diabetes, and geographic differences. Incidence of AMI in people with diabetes remained significantly higher than in those without diabetes. A reduction in the incidence of AMI over time was observed in some, but not all reviewed studies in people with diabetes. There was no discernible trend of estimates comparing people with and without diabetes. These findings underscore the necessity for additional initiatives to prevent coronary heart disease in people with diabetes. The observed discrepancy in study results is presumably attributable to variations in the population and regional contexts, as well as to disparate methodological approaches. More standardized studies employing comparable methodologies are therefore required.

Despite overlapping remodeling features, their distinct mechanisms and therapeutic responses remain unclear. This study integrated genetic, imaging, and proteomic data to identify key mediators underlying \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockers (\u03b21-blockers)-related therapeutic heterogeneity between HHD and HCM. Genetic instruments for \u03b21-blockers were derived from two genome-wide association studies and integrated with cardiac magnetic resonance radiomic traits and plasma proteomic data from the UK Biobank, along with disease outcomes from FinnGen. A refined two-stage network Mendelian randomization framework with pleiotropy-robust estimators identified mediators of treatment response. To further elucidate their biological and clinical significance, additional analyses were performed, including drug-target profiling, molecular docking, adverse events (AEs) assessment, and drug prediction. We identified three types of imaging features and ten mediator proteins that contributed to therapeutic responses in HHD and HCM. These mediators were categorized as either mediating (aligned with therapeutic outcomes) or suppressing (opposing therapeutic outcomes). Left ventricular regional radial strain acted as a suppressing factor in HHD but a mediating factor in HCM, whereas end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes consistently showed suppressing effects in both. Regional myocardial wall thickness also exerted a suppressing role in HCM. Among protein mediators, APOE, CGREF1, ITGA5, LSP1, NOS3, and NPPB were linked to HHD, whereas DUSP13, ITGA11, NID1, and SERPINA4 were related to HCM. Specifically, APOE, ITGA5, NOS3, NPPB, DUSP13, and ITGA11 acted as mediating factors, while CGREF1, LSP1, NID1, and SERPINA4 served as suppressing ones. These findings remained robust after pleiotropy adjustment and other genetic analyses. Molecular docking revealed interactions between ADRB1, the \u03b21-blockers target, and downstream proteins, while drug prediction identified eight potential compounds linked to these mediators. Additionally, AE analyses indicated that some targets, such as DUSP13, could both mitigate and aggravate common AEs while contributing to cardiac therapy. This integrative multi-omics analysis revealed distinct imaging and proteomic mechanisms of genetically proxied \u03b21-blockers in HHD and HCM, providing genetic evidence for differential therapeutic responses and highlighting molecular targets for precision cardiovascular therapy.","91":"The prevalence of raised blood pressure (RBP) in Cambodia has nearly doubled over the past decade. This study aimed to examine the associated factors and quantify the magnitude of educational and economic inequalities in relation to the prevalence of RBP among Cambodian adults. Data were obtained from the 2023 STEPwise approach to noncommunicable disease risk factor surveillance. The study included 3,186 adults aged 18-69 years. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to identify potential associated factors for RBP. The magnitude of educational and economic inequalities was assessed using the regression-based slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII). Overall, the prevalence of RBP was 16.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.5%-18.1%). The main associated factors for RBP were age 40-49 years (odds ratio [OR]: 4.97, 95% CI: 2.51-9.85), 50-59 years (OR:10.67, 95%CI: 5.52-20.62), and 60-69 years (OR:12.92, 95%CI: 6.55-25.48), overweight (OR:1.66, 95%CI:1.19-2.33), obesity (OR: 3.52, 95% CI: 2.38-5.21), and comorbid diabetes (OR: 2.53, 95% CI:1.81-3.54). Female sex (OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.25-0.63), current usage of smoking tobacco products (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.27-0.83), adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables (OR: 0.63, 95%CI: 0.46-0.85), and underweight (OR:0.33, 95%CI:0.18-0.61) were associated with reduced risk of RBP. Substantial educational inequality was observed in relation to the prevalence of RBP, with RBP disproportionately affecting individuals without formal schooling at the national (SII: -18.9, 95% CI: -24.80 to -12.90, p\u2009<\u20090.001), rural-urban, and regional levels. Nationally, individuals with higher education levels were 67% less likely to have RBP than those without formal schooling (RII: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17-0.66). Significant absolute economic inequalities in RBP prevalence, to the disadvantage of poor households, were also observed among urban residents (SII: -10.8, 95% CI: -20.10 to -1.50, p\u2009<\u20090.05) as well as those living in the plateau and mountain regions (SII: -13.8, 95% CI: -26.10 to -1.40, p\u2009<\u20090.05). RBP remains a major public health challenge in Cambodia, with substantial educational and context-specific economic inequalities. Addressing these social determinants through equity-oriented, context-sensitive interventions is essential to reduce the burden of RBP and prevent cardiovascular diseases in the Cambodian population.","92":"A pathological link exists between mitochondrial fission\/fusion imbalance and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), based on concepts such as \"Qi stagnation and blood stasis\" and \"Yin-Yang imbalance,\" helps balance mitochondrial function through the combined effects of multiple components, providing a comprehensive treatment approach for CVD. To methodically clarify the molecular processes by which TCM formulations, extracts, and bioactive compounds target mitochondrial dynamics to intervene in CVD over the past five years, highlighting their ethnopharmacological significance in \"multi-component and multi-target\" synergistic actions. This study searched PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang, and VIP databases (2019-2024), using the Boolean search formula: (\"cardiovascular disease\" OR \"CVD\") AND (\"mitochondrial dynamics\" OR \"mitochondrial fission\" OR \"mitochondrial fusion\") AND (\"Traditional Chinese Medicine\" OR \"TCM\") AND (\"active compounds\" OR \"bioactive components\"). After deduplication with EndNote, 183 articles were systematically screened and included, comprising in vitro experiments using cardiomyocyte models, in vivo studies based on animal models of CVD, and mechanistic investigations utilizing ex vivo tissues or cellular experiments (all human clinical trials were excluded). Formulations such as Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD) and Qishen Yiqi Dropping Pills (QSYQ) improved heart conditions by reducing dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) overactivity and increasing mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) levels. Bioactive compounds, such as salidroside(Sal), prevented Drp1 from causing mitochondria to split apart by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase(AMPK)\/Sirtuin 1(SIRT1) pathway, while astragaloside IV facilitated better mitochondrial fusion to enhance energy utilization. TCM manages mitochondria dynamics through multi-target mechanisms, connecting \"overall treatment\" with \"specific targeting\" for heart disease therapy. Further ethnopharmacological translation requires standardized screening of bioactive components and the development of innovative drug delivery systems. The study suggests a \"Traditional Chinese Medicine-Mitochondrial Dynamics Intervention Model (TCM-MDIM),\" which combines organelle-level mitochondrial regulation with the principle of balancing blood and qi to offer novel approaches to the targeted therapy of cardiovascular disorders.","93":"No abstract available","94":"Preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and fetal growth restriction (FGR) are maternal complications that affect intrauterine growth and cardiovascular adaptation of fetuses. This study aimed to determine whether early fetal cardiac function predicts birth weight, gestational age at delivery, and the occurrence of maternal and fetal complications. In this prospective cohort, there were 101 singleton pregnancies that had been evaluated at 20-22 gestational weeks using detailed fetal echocardiography. Maternal age, body mass index (BMI) and pregnancy complications (preeclampsia, GDM, FGR) were documented. Fetal parameters of echocardiography were left and right ventricular size, systolic function parameters, stroke volume, and cardiac output. To find the predictors of birth weight, gestational age, and complications, multivariate linear regression was conducted. In preeclamptic mothers, fetuses had smaller ventricular dimensions but maintained systolic function, and FGR fetuses had smaller areas of LV end-diastolic and RV end-systolic. GDM was not tied to a significant heart defect in the fetus or birth weight. Maternal age was not linked to any fetal cardiac or birth outcome. These structural alterations in preeclampsia and FGR suggest subclinical cardiac remodeling, detectable in mid-gestation, which may represent early biomarkers of adverse outcomes. Fetal cardiac parameters were not significant predictors of birth weight; however, maternal BMI was strongly associated with birth weight. (p<0.001). Early remodelling without functional deficiency is indicated by subclinical structural cardiac variations in preeclampsia and FGR, which highlight the importance of targeted attention during high-risk pregnancy and the use of weight optimization strategies before pregnancy.","95":"Whether physical activity (PA) levels relate to mortality in postmenopausal women remains not well understood. We analyzed 5,880 postmenopausal women from NHANES 2007-2018 (median follow-up:77 months). PA-including total PA (TPA), leisure-time PA (LTPA), and occupational PA (OPA)-was assessed using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire and expressed as metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-minutes\/week. TPA was classified as no, insufficiently active (<\u2009600), or sufficiently active (\u2265\u2009600), while LTPA and OPA were classified as no, low (<\u2009600), or high (\u2265\u2009600). Weighted proportional hazards Cox models and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses examined associations with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and non-CVD mortality. During follow-up, 718 deaths occurred (215 CVD, 503 non-CVD). Compared with no PA, insufficiently and sufficiently active TPA were associated with reduced risks of all-cause, CVD, and non-CVD mortality; both low and high LTPA with reduced risks of all-cause and non-CVD mortality; and low OPA with reduced risks of all-cause and non-CVD mortality. RCS analyses showed linear inverse associations for TPA and non-linear inverse associations for LTPA with all-cause and non-CVD mortality, while OPA showed no significant associations. Tests for trend were significant for TPA in relation to all-cause and non-CVD mortality, and for LTPA across all three outcomes. Sensitivity analyses excluding early deaths yielded similar results. Higher TPA and LTPA were associated with reduced risks of all-cause and non-CVD mortality among postmenopausal women. Promoting adequate PA, particularly moving from inactivity to modest levels, may be an effective strategy to support healthy aging in this population.","96":"Early identification of disability risk in community-dwelling older adults has emerged as a critical public health priority. An increasing number of studies have focused on developing predictive models for disability risk among community-dwelling older adults. The quality, risk of bias and applicability of these models remain unclear. To systematically review and critically assess the existing disability risk prediction models in community-dwelling older adults. PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP) Database and Wanfang Database were searched from inception to February 28, 2025. Two reviewers independently identified eligible articles and extracted data using the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS). The methodological quality, risk of bias, and applicability of the included studies were assessed with the updated Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool integrated with artificial intelligence (PROBAST\u2009+\u2009AI). A total of 19 studies involving 19 prediction models were included. 19 models evaluated model discrimination, with the AUC or c-index ranging from 0.620 to 0.853 in the model development section and from 0.650 to 0.804 in the model validation section. And the most common predictors included age, physical function, cognitive function, cardiovascular disease, and sex. According to the PROBAST\u2009+\u2009AI, eighteen models were rated as high quality concerns in the development section and sixteen models were rated as high risk of bias in the evaluation section, alongside fifteen models were rated as high concerns of applicability. Current disability risk prediction models for community-dwelling older adults demonstrate good discriminatory performance but are characterized by significant methodological limitations and high risk of bias. Future research should rigorously adhere to reporting standards for risk prediction models in both developing and evaluating such models for older community populations, with further validation of their clinical applicability in practice. PROSPERO registration number: CRD420251001479.","97":"No abstract available","98":"Symptoms can negatively impact health-related quality of life (HrQoL) in older adults, yet data on their prevalence and impact in older men are limited. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of nine core symptoms and their associations with HrQoL in older men. A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted among 907 men aged 73 years in Sweden. Participants rated nine symptoms on a 0-10 scale: pain, tiredness, sleepiness, nausea, loss of appetite, depression, anxiety, shortness of breath, and overall well-being. Symptoms were considered present if scored\u2009\u2265\u20091. HrQoL was measured using the physical and mental component scores of the Short-Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12v2). Associations were analyzed using linear regression adjusted for confounders. Among participants, 16% reported respiratory diseases and 35% cardiovascular diseases. The most common symptoms were tiredness (78%), poor well-being (77%), and pain (73%). Depression and anxiety were reported by 46% and 32%, respectively. The strongest associations between symptoms and physical HrQoL were (beta coefficient; 95% confidence interval): pain (-2.05; -2.25 to -2.24), tiredness (-1.98; -2.22 to -1.74), and shortness of breath (-1.73; -1.97 to -1.49) and for mental HrQOL: depression (-3.50; -3.74 to -3.27), anxiety (-3.40; -3.70 to -3.11), drowsiness (-2.35; -2,64 to -2.07), and tiredness (-2.30; -2.56 to -2.03). Symptoms are highly prevalent among older men and significantly associated with lower HrQoL and pain, tiredness, depression, and anxiety were the most impactful. These findings underscore the importance of targeted symptom screening and management to promote healthy aging and well-being."},"url":{"0":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668192\/","1":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668130\/","2":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668125\/","3":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668104\/","4":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668062\/","5":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668046\/","6":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668035\/","7":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667943\/","8":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667925\/","9":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667858\/","10":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667839\/","11":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667802\/","12":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667791\/","13":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667776\/","14":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667743\/","15":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667698\/","16":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667648\/","17":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667617\/","18":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667508\/","19":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667361\/","20":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667346\/","21":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667324\/","22":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667319\/","23":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667233\/","24":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667219\/","25":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667187\/","26":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667178\/","27":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667173\/","28":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667167\/","29":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667155\/","30":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667153\/","31":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667131\/","32":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667119\/","33":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667089\/","34":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667033\/","35":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667012\/","36":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666968\/","37":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666954\/","38":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666933\/","39":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666882\/","40":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666876\/","41":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666739\/","42":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666635\/","43":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666634\/","44":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666573\/","45":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666539\/","46":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666464\/","47":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666173\/","48":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666166\/","49":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666164\/","50":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666161\/","51":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666111\/","52":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665972\/","53":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665888\/","54":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665869\/","55":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665811\/","56":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665731\/","57":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665703\/","58":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665678\/","59":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665555\/","60":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665553\/","61":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665533\/","62":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665459\/","63":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665140\/","64":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665100\/","65":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665042\/","66":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665021\/","67":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664967\/","68":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664931\/","69":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664927\/","70":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664921\/","71":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664849\/","72":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664771\/","73":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664770\/","74":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664753\/","75":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664676\/","76":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664511\/","77":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664438\/","78":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664420\/","79":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664413\/","80":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664370\/","81":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664369\/","82":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664358\/","83":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664290\/","84":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664278\/","85":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664248\/","86":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664233\/","87":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664231\/","88":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664230\/","89":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664210\/","90":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664179\/","91":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664115\/","92":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664100\/","93":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664045\/","94":"h
