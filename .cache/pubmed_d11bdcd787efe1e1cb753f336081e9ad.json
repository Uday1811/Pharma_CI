Favipiravir (FAV), an antiviral drug primarily used for influenza, has shown promising potential in treating COVID-19 and other RNA viral infections. A precise, reliable, and rapid fluorimetric method was established for the quantification of FAV in pharmaceutical formulations, even in the presence of its acid-induced degradation product. The acid-induced degradation product (ADP) of FAV was prepared through forced degradation, followed by characterization using IR and MS. The method leveraged the intrinsic fluorescence characteristics of FAV, exhibiting a linear response within the concentration range of 5-80 ng\/mL at 416.5\u00a0nm using the first-order derivative processing. Key methodological parameters were optimized to enhance sensitivity, achieving detection and quantification limits of 1.6 ng\/mL and 4.8 ng\/mL, respectively. All calibration and fluorimetric measurement steps were performed in distilled water without the use of organic solvents or buffers, making the analytical determination phase entirely aqueous and environmentally benign. This method was effectively applied to FAV in both pure drug and pharmaceutical dosage forms. Compared with previously reported fluorimetric methods, it offers the unique combination of aqueous-based operation, stability-indicating capability, and superior analytical performance. Additionally, its environmental sustainability was evaluated using GAPI, AGREE, and RGB12 metrics, which confirmed its green and eco-friendly attributes.","1":"No abstract available","2":"Children and adolescents living with HIV face unique physical, psychological, and social challenges that can significantly affect their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Understanding the dimensions and determinants of HRQoL among them is crucial to developing solutions to improve their overall well-being. This research aimed to assess the HRQoL and its determinants among children and adolescents living with HIV in Eastern Uganda. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 228 respondents. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were assessed using an investigator-designed questionnaire, and HRQoL was assessed using the World Health Organization HIV Quality of Life - BREF tool. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify independent factors associated with HRQoL. The mean age of the respondents was 13.68\u2009\u00b1\u20091.95 years, 129 (56.58%) were female, and 182 (79.82%) perceived high support from friends. The mean QoL was highest within the spiritual domain (17.07\u2009\u00b1\u20093.11), while the independence domain indicated the lowest quality of life (14.57\u2009\u00b1\u20092.26). Approximately 48.5% attained the mean overall QoL score (96.22). Better financial status (being not well off or quite well off) was significantly associated with higher scores across physical, psychological, independence, environmental, spiritual, and overall QoL (p\u2009<\u20090.05). High perceived family support was also positively associated with higher psychological, environmental, spiritual, and overall QoL scores. In contrast, family history of mental illness and the presence of other chronic illnesses were significantly associated with lower psychological and environmental scores. Being Muslim\/other religion was associated with lower physical domain scores, while being in high school or above was linked to better environmental scores. Spirituality was a key source of emotional support, reflected in the highest QoL scores, while low independence scores suggest that stigma and overprotection may hinder autonomy and social development. Although overall QoL was generally good, disparities across domains underscore the need for targeted interventions. Improved financial status and strong family support were consistently associated with better QoL outcomes, while comorbid conditions and a family history of mental illness negatively impacted well-being among children and adolescents living with HIV in Eastern Uganda.","3":"No abstract available","4":"No abstract available","5":"Inflammatory dermatoses like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are prevalent autoimmune disorders whose management is challenged not only by inflammatory lesions but, more significantly, by persistent pruritus and frequent relapse following treatment discontinuation. The pathogenic progression of these dermatoses is critically influenced by an imbalance between pro-inflammatory adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and anti-inflammatory cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), alongside reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. To address this imbalance and effectively scavenge ROS, we have developed AC@Mg\/Ce-UiO, integrating adenylate cyclase (AC) with a defect-engineered Mg\/Ce-UiO nanozyme, for inflammatory dermatosis treatment and recurrence prevention. Mg\/Ce-UiO nanozyme, synthesized through a metal-substitution strategy, demonstrates enhanced superoxide dismutase-like and catalase-like activities, facilitating efficient ROS scavenging. Concurrently, the encapsulated AC enzyme catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cAMP. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that AC@Mg\/Ce-UiO markedly downregulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines and pruritogens, inhibits keratinocyte hyperproliferation, and diminishes the infiltration of immune memory T cells. Consequently, this nanozyme not only alleviates psoriatic symptoms (e.g., lesions and pruritus), but also decreases the likelihood of recurrence. This study introduces a safe and potent dual-catalytic therapy that targets the fundamental pathogenesis of inflammatory dermatoses, providing a promising strategy for achieving long-term remission and preventing recurrence.","6":"No abstract available","7":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and potentially fatal complication in orthopedic trauma patients, particularly following lower limb and hip-related fractures. While pharmacological prophylaxis is the cornerstone of prevention for patients at moderate to high risk, its use is a balance between efficacy and bleeding risk. Clinical pharmacists play an increasingly important role in optimizing pharmacotherapy, but evidence for the effectiveness of a comprehensive, pharmacist-led management model spanning both inpatient and outpatient care for VTE prophylaxis in this population is scarce. This is a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial. One hundred seventy eligible orthopedic trauma patients at risk for VTE will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group will receive a pharmacist-led, full-course management model, which includes personalized VTE risk (Caprini score) and bleeding risk assessment, medication reconciliation, patient education, dosing optimization, adverse event monitoring, and structured follow-up via telephone at 21, 35, and 90\u00a0days post-discharge. The control group will receive standard medical care without this structured pharmacist intervention. The primary outcome is the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic VTE within 90\u00a0days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events, medication adherence (measured by Medication Possession Ratio). Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. This randomized controlled trial aims to generate high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of a clinical pharmacist-led management model for improving outcomes in orthopedic trauma patients requiring VTE prophylaxis. The study has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (retrospectively registered no. ChiCTR2500107932) on 21 August 2025, at https:\/\/www.chictr.org.cn\/showproj?proj=279391.","8":"Streptococcus anginosus is a Gram-positive coccus that can increase gastric cancer risk through interaction with the TMPC-ANXA2-MAPK axis in gastric epithelial cells. There is currently no commercially available vaccine, and prolonged antibiotic treatment may increase drug resistance. We developed a Treponema pallidum membrane protein C (TMPC)-based multi-epitope vaccine targeting nine TMPC-positive streptococcal species dominated by S. anginosus. B-cell and T-cell epitopes were chosen based on their binding affinity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and safety, with adjuvants and linker sequences improving construct stability and immune response. Immune simulations predicted robust humoral and cellular responses, such as cytokine production and memory cell activation. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics analysis further confirmed stable interactions between the vaccine construct and key immune receptors (HLA-A*02:01, HLA-DRB1*01:01, TLR2, and TLR4). The antigen was further modified as a messenger RNA vaccine to enhance cytotoxic T-cell induction; however, animal research is needed to confirm its immunogenicity and protective effectiveness.","9":"Rift valley fever virus (RVFV) is among the WHO list of priority diseases, yet no effective vaccine or treatment is currently available. Microbial pigments (MPs) represent a promising small-molecules library which can be exploited for the drug discovery of anti-RVFV compound. In this study, thirteen MPs were in silico screened to identify candidates with acceptable drug-likeness and possible ability to cross the blood brain barrier. Next, the binding interaction of the filtered molecules were compared against key RVFV proteins for the selection of the optimum inhibitor. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed (200 ns) to further evaluate the interactions. The selected candidate (pyocyanin; PCN) was produced, purified and analytically characterized in-house. Finally, the antiviral potential of PCN was tested in vitro against RVFV using the tissue culture infection dose 50% (TCID<sub>50<\/sub>) method. In silico screening studies revealed that prodigiosin and PCN exhibit ideal drug-likeness properties. PCN exerted a promising in silico interaction with the key RVFV proteins as revealed by the molecular docking and dynamic studies. Results showed that PCN may be effectively produced and purified from bacterial cultures. Its cell-safe concentration (0.49 \u03bcg\/mL) demonstrated a promising 2.89 log<sub>10<\/sub> reduction in TCID<sub>50<\/sub> when incubated with RVFV infected cells. A lower effect was observed (2.00 log<sub>10<\/sub> reduction) in cells treated with PCN prior to RVFV infection. These results suggest that PCN may represent a potential effective low-cost molecule to combat RVFV.","10":"Williams syndrome is a rare genetic condition frequently associated with cardiovascular anomalies, particularly supravalvular aortic stenosis. The coexistence of supravalvular aortic stenosis, aneurysmal dilation, and infective endocarditis with vegetations in the aortic arch is exceedingly rare. We describe an 8-year-old Arab boy from Syria with Williams syndrome who presented with fatigue, tachycardia, dyspnea, fever, chills, and night sweats. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated aortic arch with large vegetation at the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk and supravalvular aortic stenosis. Despite 10 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy, vegetations persisted, necessitating urgent surgery. The ascending aorta was replaced using the McGoon technique with complete excision of infected tissue. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and follow-up imaging showed good left ventricular function without aortic gradient. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and timely surgical intervention in preventing catastrophic outcomes in patients with Williams syndrome and complex cardiovascular involvement.","11":"No abstract available","12":"Low Back Pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide, 90% of which is nonspecific. Manual therapy is one of the recommended treatment modalities. However, reported outcomes may be variable. This review aims to identify their scope in the context of the development of a Core Outcome Set (COS), which is defined as \u00ab an agreed standardised set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials in specific areas of health or health care \u00bb. A scoping review with risk of bias assessment of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of manual therapy for nonspecific LBP was conducted using MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PEDro, WebOfScience and ClinicalTrials.gov, from 2010 up to August 2024. Manual therapy was considered the use, alone or in combination, of manipulations (high velocity, low amplitude), mobilisations (low-grade velocity, small-to-large amplitude) or soft tissue relaxation (especially massage, trigger points, muscle contractions). Out of 3929 articles, 147 RCTs and 74 protocols were included. Two main outcomes emerged: pain intensity (assessed by numerical rating scale or visual analogue scale) and disability (mostly assessed by Rolland-Morris Disability Questionnaire or Oswestry Disability Index). Range of motion is the most frequent clinical outcome assessed. Psychological factors such as fear-avoidance beliefs, kinesiophobia and catastrophising, and healthcare consumption, particularly medication, are also frequent. Most of the outcomes were patient-reported outcomes. Consistent with a previous COS on nonspecific low back pain, manual therapy appears to address the same outcomes. Clinical trials in manual therapy should focus on using the existing COS by measuring pain intensity using a numerical rating scale, disability using the ODI 2.1a or the 24-item RMDQ, health-related quality of life using the SF-12 or the 10-item PROMIS. Additionally, due to the gap between clinical research and pain experience, trials should consider conducting subgroup analyses to identify effects on outcomes related to gender or age, paying particular attention to health inequalities by carrying out analyses based on socioeconomic status, as these factors are well known to significantly impact pain experience and access to care.

Accumulated evidence has demonstrated lactylation plays a vital role in the metabolic reprogramming. However the mechanisms underlying the role of lactylation in the regulation of HCC progression remain largely unknown. This study aims to construct a prognostic model based on lactylation-related metabolism genes, and further explore its prognostic significance and biological function in HCC. In this study, a robust prognostic prediction model has been constructed employing a complex machine learning framework using public bulk RNA-seq and proteomic HCC dataset. Moreover, the clinical application of this model was explored, and its biological functions were validated using several in vitro experiments. Subsequently, we performed functional analysis, survival analysis, tumor immune microenvironment analysis and drug sensitivity to demonstrate our model's potential in translational cancer medicine. We developed an integrative machine learning-based computational framework to generate a predictive Metabolism-related Lactylation Index (MRLI) within four independent HCC cohorts and validated its prognostic accuracy through various algorithms. Notably, compared to published gene signatures, MRLI demonstrated robust predictive capability. In addition, single-cell analysis demonstrated that the MRLI is predominantly localized within HCC cells and correlates with tumor malignancy. Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested that the MRLI may be associated with cellular proliferation and metabolic reprogramming, which was further confirmed by experimental evidence. Subsequently, public spatial transcriptomics and bulk RNA-seq analysis revealing that the highly MRLI predicts a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, which was further verification in a cohort of 40 HCC samples by multiple immunofluorescence. Additionally, groups with highly MRLI showed decreased sensitivity to sorafenib, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and TACE, highlighting the potential of MRLI in facilitating personalized treatment strategies. Our study has developed a novel MRLI as a predictive marker for prognosis and therapeutic outcomes in patients with HCC. These findings indicate that lactylation promotes malignant cell phenotypes and immune microenvironment remodeling partially through metabolic regulation, suggesting it as a potential clinical therapeutic target.","18":"Synthetic lethality (SL) is a therapeutic approach that selectively target cancer cells via the disruption of two interdependent molecular targets, which together become essential in the cancer context to ensure cancer cell survival. Among anticancer SL strategies, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of homologous recombination repair deficient breast and ovarian cancers by targeting the remaining DNA repair mechanisms. However, resistance emergence is nearly universal providing the rationale to expand beyond classical DNA repair targets. Severe DNA lesions like double-strand breaks or extended single-strand stretches trigger the complex DNA damage response signaling cascade (DDR), which provides many SL targets in addition to direct DNA repair mechanisms. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy, in part because of late detection and treatment resistance, which provides a rich environment to explore the concept of combining multiple targets to produce SL synergies that kill cancer cells. In this context we discuss the interplay among varied components of the DDR including DNA damage signalers, cell cycle regulation, metabolism, epigenetics, and subsequent cell fate decisions like apoptosis or senescence. Based on this knowledge we further explore innovative SL approaches that may elicit or restore drug sensitivity in resistant tumors. Overall, we provide the rationale for multidimensional strategies linking classic DNA repair mechanisms to various molecular vulnerabilities sometimes apparently unrelated or downstream from DNA damage to improve cancer treatment outcomes via more effective and durable therapeutic responses, offering additional options for the personalized treatment of this highly heterogeneous disease.","19":"Ethnically diverse populations can present variations in cardiovascular risk, which can be influenced by differences in lipid profiles and other cardiovascular risk factors. This study aimed to evaluate lipid profiles and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in a Mediterranean population, with a focus on variations by ethnicity and sex. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study using the \"Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care\" (SIDIAP) database, which includes primary care data from Catalonia, Spain, collected between 2015 and 2019. The study included subjects aged 40 to 89 years with no prior history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or lipid-lowering therapy. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare lipid profiles and traditional risk factors across ethnic groups and sex. We included 806,458 participants, 56.8% women, 89.9% from Southern Europe, 5.3% from Latin America and Caribbean origin, 3% from North Africa, 0.8% from Central\/South Africa and 1% from Asia. Asian individuals presented the most atherogenic lipid profile, with the lower HDL-C, higher triglyceride levels, and elevated atherogenic indices. Higher LDL-C values were observed in Latin American men and Southern European women. Among the groups studied, Central and South Africans presented the most favorable lipid profiles, with low triglyceride and atherogenic indices, regardless of sex. North Africans and Latin Americans presented higher obesity rates, whilst southern Europeans presented the highest prevalence rates of hypertension and smoking. Individuals from Asia have worse lipid and metabolic profile compared with Central and South African individuals, regardless of sex. Current risk assessment tools may underestimate the cardiovascular risk in these specific populations.","20":"No abstract available","21":"Although androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies have shown notable clinical efficacy in prostate cancer (PCa), the emergence of drug resistance remains a critical factor driving the clinical prognosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Aberrant tumor lipid metabolism not only fulfills the energetic and biosynthetic requirements of rapidly proliferating cancer cells but also contributes to the development of therapeutic resistance. We examined SOX8 expression in enzalutamide resistance (EnzR) cell lines and validated its association with tumor progression and clinical outcome. The malignant phenotypes related to EnzR were assessed in vitro using PCa cell lines with stable SOX8 overexpression or knockdown. Tumor xenografts were subsequently generated by inoculating the corresponding cell lines into nude mice. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted RNA-seq, CUT&Tag, non-targeted metabolomics, and a series of molecular and biochemical assays. SOX8 expression was elevated in EnzR prostate cancer cell lines and positively correlated with poor patient prognosis. Reduced SOX8 expression enhanced cellular sensitivity to enzalutamide, whereas elevated SOX8 expression decreased drug responsiveness. Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) assays revealed that AR was enriched at the SOX8 promoter region and transcriptionally repressed SOX8. In vivo, stable SOX8 knockdown markedly suppressed tumor growth in nude mouse xenografts. Mechanistically, SOX8 promotes the EnzR by reprograming lipid metabolism and we identified carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), a key enzyme in lipid metabolism, as a novel downstream target of SOX8. SOX8-driven lipid metabolic reprogramming promoted enzalutamide resistance through the SOX8\/CPT2 axis. High SOX8 expression promotes EnzR in PCa, suggesting SOX8 as a potential therapeutic target. Our findings demonstrate that SOX8 drives EnzR by activating the SOX8\/CPT2 axis, thereby inducing lipid metabolic reprogramming in PCa cells.","22":"Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) offer a powerful therapeutic modality by integrating the targeting specificity of peptides with the cytotoxic efficacy of chemotherapeutics, thereby improving antitumor performance while reducing off-target toxicity. In this study, we engineered biometallic PDCs composed of peptide nanofibers (PNFs), gold nanoparticles (GNPs), and doxorubicin (DOX), termed PGDCs, and incorporated them into photo-responsive dual-network hyaluronic acid hydrogels for combined photothermal and chemotherapeutic (PTT\/CT) treatment of breast cancer. The hydrogel was formed by mixing oxidized methacrylated hyaluronic acid (O-HAMA) with PGDCs, followed by rapid photo-crosslinking under 365\u00a0nm UV light, achieving gelation within 90\u00a0s for localized, on-demand drug deployment. The resulting O-HAMA\/PGDC hydrogels exhibited pH-responsive drug release under tumor microenvironments and robust photothermal performance under NIR irradiation. In vitro and in vivo evaluations revealed strong tumor suppression, with 98% inhibition efficiency, effective tumor ablation, and minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissues. The structural modularity of PGDCs-allowing simultaneous integration of metals, peptides, and drugs-opens pathways for designing highly effective, tumor-selective nanotherapeutics with controlled activation, efficient internalization, and combined therapeutic outcomes.","23":"Luspatercept is a recombinant fusion protein that enhances late-stage erythropoiesis by inhibiting select transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) superfamily ligands. It is approved for transfusion-dependent \u03b2-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts. Kidney toxicity has been rarely reported in humans, although glomerular lesions have been described in preclinical studies. We report the case of a 74-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome with ring sideroblasts treated with luspatercept for persistent anemia. She developed acute kidney injury, glomerular-range proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and leukocyturia. Renal biopsy revealed a diffuse mesangial sclerosing glomerulopathy characterized by prominent mesangial matrix expansion with minimal proliferative changes, no immune complex deposits on immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. Luspatercept was discontinued, leading to a partial improvement in renal function but persistent proteinuria. This case documents a non-immune mesangial sclerosing glomerulopathy temporally associated with luspatercept therapy. Only one other case of biopsy-proven renal injury linked to luspatercept has previously been published, with an immune complex-mediated MPGN. Clinicians should be aware of possible renal involvement during luspatercept treatment and consider systematic monitoring of kidney function and urinalysis in treated patients. Further data are needed to clarify the spectrum and mechanisms of renal adverse events associated with this drug.","24":"Phenobarbital (PB) has long been considered the standard first-line therapy for neonatal seizures, despite suboptimal efficacy and concerns about neurotoxicity and adverse cardiopulmonary effects. Levetiracetam (LEV), a newer antiseizure medication with a more favorable safety profile, has emerged as a potential alternative. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of LEV versus PB when used as first-line treatment for neonatal seizures. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to September 2025 identified eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing first-line LEV with PB in neonates. Data were pooled using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity, publication bias, and potential effect modifiers were explored through subgroup, and meta-regression analyses. Twenty-six studies (13 RCTs and 13 observational cohorts) including 9,854 neonates (LEV\u2009=\u20091,601; PB\u2009=\u20098,253) were analyzed. The overall rate of seizure control did not differ significantly between LEV and PB (RR\u2009=\u20090.92, 95% CI 0.82-1.03; p\u2009=\u20090.16). Subgroup analyses by study design yielded consistent findings. LEV was associated with significantly fewer adverse events (RR\u2009=\u20093.59, 95% CI 1.85-6.95; I\u00b2 = 86%), particularly lower risks of hypotension (RR\u2009=\u20093.90, 95% CI 1.94-7.87) and respiratory depression (RR\u2009=\u20092.06, 95% CI 1.23-3.47) compared with PB. Mortality rates were similar between groups (RR\u2009=\u20091.27, 95% CI 0.84-1.91). Meta-regression revealed that higher gestational age and birth weight were associated with better seizure control, whereas older age at seizure onset predicted poorer response. LEV and PB demonstrate comparable efficacy for first-line treatment of neonatal seizures; however, LEV provides a more favorable safety and tolerability profile, particularly with respect to cardiopulmonary stability. These findings support the consideration of LEV as an alternative first-line agent, especially in neonates at risk for hemodynamic or respiratory compromise. Further large, high-quality RCTs with standardized EEG confirmation and long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up are warranted.","25":"For people with HIV (PWH), long-acting antiretroviral therapies (LA-ART) are promising treatment alternatives to daily oral regimens, with potential to improve adherence and achieve viral suppression. Understanding patient preferences is crucial for successful and efficient implementation and scaling of LA-ART in resource-limited settings such as Kenya. We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit preferences for LA-ART attributes among PWH in Kenya. We recruited 700 PWH taking daily oral ART from Kenyatta National Hospital and two Sex Workers Outreach Program clinics in Nairobi. In 17 choice scenarios, participants chose between their current daily oral regimen and two hypothetical LA-ART alternatives defined by seven attributes: delivery mode (long-acting oral, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, implant), administration location (clinic, chemist, home), frequency (weekly, every 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12 months), delivery-site pain (none, mild, moderate), pre-treatment viral suppression (required, not required), pre-treatment negative reaction testing (required, not required), and late-dose leeway (short, long). We used conditional logistic regressions with interactions between mode and pain to determine the relative importance in participants' choices across attributes. Participants had a median age of 36 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 28-46); 64% were female, 83% were virally suppressed, 51% were from key populations (e.g., sex workers or men who have sex with men), and median time on ART was 9 years (IQR: 5-15). Participants generally preferred the hypothetical LA-ART options over their current daily oral ART, and the interaction of delivery mode and pain was the most important attribute combination. Oral LA-ART was the most preferred mode; 1-year implants with mild pain was the next preferred option. Participants favored administration at clinics to chemists or home and preferred less frequent dosing. LA-ART would be highly acceptable in Kenya, with oral LA-ART and administration at clinics as the preferred formulation and location. Our findings provide valuable evidence to guide the development of novel LA-ART products. Future research should evaluate preference heterogeneity and investigate ways to effectively scale LA-ART in Kenya and similar settings, while taking into account patient preferences.

This study aimed to present Chinese data on CTIT and organ bleeding in patients undergoing emergency oncology. This retrospective study was conducted in the Oncology Emergency Department. We evaluated the clinical features and outcomes of CTIT and associated organ hemorrhage. A retrospective analysis collected data from 8590 cases of malignant tumor emergency visits. Among these, 1164 cases (13.5%) of CTIT met the inclusion criteria, with a median patient age of 61\u2009years. 61 (5.24%) of the 1164 CTIT cases were associated with overt organ hemorrhage. Independent risk factors predicting CTIT deterioration included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 2-4 (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20094.883), stage IV (OR\u2009=\u20092.275), organ bleeding (OR\u2009=\u20093.029), anemia (OR\u2009=\u20093.243), and fever (OR\u2009=\u20095.360), all with p\u2009<\u20090.05. Among the 61 cases with bleeding, 41% (25\/61) involved lung cancer. The bleeding group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with fever (11.5% vs. 2.9%), pleural effusion (25.0% vs. 9.8%), and malnutrition requiring parenteral nutritional support (9.8% vs. 2.8%) compared to the non-bleeding group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Fever (OR\u2009=\u20094.886, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and pleural effusion (OR\u2009=\u20094.812, p\u2009=\u20090.007) were identified as independent risk factors for CTIT-related bleeding. Malignancies associated with reduced platelet counts and additional risk factors require heightened clinical vigilance for hemorrhage development.","28":"No abstract available","29":"<b>Objective:<\/b> To examine the clinical application value of robot-assisted esophageal suspension-traction combined with the \"four-edge\" dissociation in the lymph node dissection of left recurrent laryngeal nerve of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. <b>Methods:<\/b> This is a retrospective case series study. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 127 cases of robot-assisted McKeown minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) with complete medical records and follow-up data, and without neoadjuvant therapy, performed at the Department of Minimally Invasive Esophagus Surgery, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital from January 2022 to December 2024. Among them, there were 116 males and 11 females, aged (63.0\u00b16.0) years (range: 44 to 79 years). There were 13 cases of upper thoracic esophageal cancer, 69 cases of middle thoracic esophageal cancer, and 45 cases of lower thoracic esophageal cancer. The lymph node dissection method in the 106recL station was the en bloc resection for robot-assisted esophageal suspension-traction combined with the \"four-edge\" dissociation. Under the assistance of the robot, the operating space in the left recurrent laryngeal nerve area was increased and exposed by suspending and pulling the esophagus; through dissociating the outer edges of the trachea, esophagus, blood vessels and nerves, the operating space was further released and bloodless was performed, thereby achieving en bloc resection of the soft tissue and lymph nodes in the left recurrent laryngeal nerve area. Statistical methods such as <i>\u03c7<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> test and univariate and multivariate Logistic regression were employed to analyze the relationship between lymph node metastasis in the 106recL station and clinical pathological characteristics. <b>Results:<\/b> Among the 127 cases of robot-assisted McKeown MIE, a total of 508 lymph nodes were dissected in the 106recL station. There were 21 cases of lymph node metastasis in the 106recL station, with a metastasis rate of 16.54% (21\/127), and the metastasis was closely related to the location of the tumor and T stage (both <i>P<\/i><0.05). Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that upper thoracic tumor (<i>OR<\/i>=3.353, 95%<i>CI<\/i>: 2.684 to 189.852, <i>P<\/i>=0.005), middle thoracic tumor (<i>OR<\/i>=2.597, 95%<i>CI<\/i>: 1.886 to 75.735, <i>P<\/i>=0.013), T4a stage (<i>OR<\/i>=1.928, 95%<i>CI<\/i>: 1.250 to 31.887, <i>P<\/i>=0.039) were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in the 106recL station of esophageal cancer. Among the 127 postoperative patients, 7 cases (5.5%) had hoarseness, 9 cases (7.1%) had pulmonary infection, 2 cases (1.6%) had anastomotic fistula, and 3 cases (2.4%) had recurrence of upper mediastinal lymph nodes. <b>Conclusions:<\/b> In McKeown MIE, the use of the en bloc resection for robot-assisted esophageal suspension-traction combined with the \"four-edge\" dissociation for lymph node dissection in the 106recL station is safe and effective, and the dissection of lymph nodes in the 106recL station is more clinically valuable in upper thoracic, middle thoracic esophageal cancer and those with a later T stage.","30":"<b>Objective:<\/b> To systematically compare the clinical outcomes of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) versus upfront surgery (US) in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. <b>Methods:<\/b> This meta-analysis was conducted following established guidelines.

Patients were allocated in a 1\u22361 ratio to either the M-ECEA group or the C-ECEA group using simple randomization. The key modification of the M-ECEA technique was as follows: the incision started at the side of the external carotid artery opposite the origin of the superior thyroid artery, descended along the external carotid artery, followed a curved path to avoid the carotid sinus and carotid body region, and ended on the internal carotid artery side of the common carotid artery; identical incisions were made on the anterior and posterior walls with complete transection, and the remaining steps were the same as for C-ECEA. All surgeries were performed by the same surgical team. Postoperative hemodynamic changes, the usage of antihypertensive medications, and short-term adverse events were collected and compared between the two groups. Data comparisons were conducted using independent sample <i>t<\/i>-tests, <i>\u03c7<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> tests, or Fisher's exact probability method. <b>Results:<\/b> A total of 100 patients were enrolled.

The ABI of the patients in the POBA group, DCB group, and constrained balloon group increased significantly on the first day after surgery compared with that before surgery, and the difference in the increase of ABI was not statistically significant (<i>P<\/i>>0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the 6-month CD-TLR freedom rate and treatment effectiveness rate among the three groups (<i>P<\/i>>0.05). Among patients free from revascularization at 6 months, the increase in ABI at 6 months after surgery in the POBA group was 0.18\u00b10.13, in the DCB group was 0.30\u00b10.08, and in the constrained balloon group was 0.32\u00b10.24, and the difference was statistically significant (<i>F<\/i>=10.955, <i>P<\/i><0.01). Among the patients with Rutherford grade 5 to 6, the wound healing rate in the DCB group was 82.8% (24\/29), which was higher than that in the POBA group (56.5%, 26\/46) (<i>\u03c7<\/i><sup>2<\/sup>=5.509, <i>P<\/i>=0.019), and there was no statistically significant difference compared with the constrained balloon group (61.9%, 13\/21) (<i>\u03c7<\/i><sup>2<\/sup>=2.753, <i>P<\/i>=0.097).

CMV-PCR and antigenemia values had a moderate linear correlation. In total, 58 patients exhibited CMV-PCR positivity before starting antigenemia-based preemptive treatment. Excluding the two patients with persistent PCR positivity, the antigenemia value subsequently reached the threshold in 31 of 54 patients. On the other hand, 25 patients had spontaneous clearance of viremia without preemptive treatment. Spontaneous clearance was associated with letermovir use and the absence of graft-versus-host disease. The clinical course of CMV infection was simulated using various CMV-PCR thresholds (range 50-1000\u00a0IU\/mL). In high-risk patients not treated with letermovir, a threshold of 50\u00a0IU\/mL enables preemptive treatment initiation without increasing overtreatment risk in patients with spontaneous clearance. However, in high-risk patients treated with letermovir, thresholds\u2009>\u2009150\u00a0IU\/mL delayed the start of preemptive treatment. In low-risk patients, a threshold of 500-750\u00a0IU\/mL balances avoiding spontaneous resolution and increasing delayed treatment. PCR thresholds of 50 and 150\u00a0IU\/mL may be appropriate for initiating preemptive therapy in high-risk patients treated and not treated with letermovir, respectively, while 500-750\u00a0IU\/mL may be optimal for low-risk patients.","34":"Nasal drug delivery offers several advantages, such as rapid onset and avoidance of hepatic first-pass metabolism, making it a promising option for delivering drugs both locally and systemically. In the early phases of pharmaceutical development, predictive tools for nasal absorption are critical for selecting suitable candidates. This study evaluates the utility of RPMI 2650 cells as an in vitro model for predicting nasal drug absorption. First, we confirmed the reproducibility of membrane permeability across two air-liquid interface culture conditions (shifted on days 1 and 3), demonstrating consistent permeability profiles and agreement with previously reported P<sub>app<\/sub> values. We investigated the correlation between the permeability of RPMI 2650 cells and both clinical nasal bioavailability (nasal BA) and the estimated human nasal fraction absorbed (nasal Fa), revealing good correlations in both cases. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a significant correlation between in vitro permeability and estimated human nasal Fa levels. Although some compounds deviated from the correlation curve, these findings indicate that RPMI 2650 cells are useful in vitro tools for predicting nasal drug absorption during the early phases of pharmaceutical development.","35":"Quality by design (QbD) and design of experiments (DoE) have become central to modern pharmaceutical development, yet most guidance and reviews treat formulation development, process optimization, and process validation as largely separate activities. This narrative review focuses specifically on oral tablet products and traces how formulation-level DoE can be used to systematically define, refine, and confirm design space across the full lifecycle of tablet development. Published case studies are organized along a formulation-to-validation pathway, beginning with the translation of the target product profile (TPP) into tablet-specific quality TPPs and critical quality attributes, followed by risk assessment and the selection of appropriate screening, mixture, and response-surface designs for both formulation and process studies. Subsequent sections highlight how DoE outputs support probabilistic and mechanistic design space definition, scale-up and technology transfer, and the alignment of Stage 1-3 process validation activities with QbD principles. Particular attention is given to challenges in integrating DoE with process analytical technology (PAT), model lifecycle management, and data-driven control strategies. This review synthesizes these elements into a practical framework for tablet scientists and manufacturing teams. We outline ways to embed DoE into QbD-based development for tablets and highlight key gaps, including the limited use of probability-based design spaces and digitally enabled validation.","36":"This study aims to analyze the safety profile of sparsentan in real-world clinical settings using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, providing insights for its clinical application. Data from the FAERS database were collected between the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2024. Adverse events (AEs) associated with sparsentan were identified using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS). The temporal distribution of AEs was further analyzed using the Weibull distribution to comprehensively assess the safety profile of the drug in clinical practice. A total of 1776 reports of AEs were retrieved from the FAERS database, with sparsentan identified as the primary suspect (PS) drug. These AEs were reported across 25 system organ classes (SOCs). Forty-four preferred terms (PTs) were retained by the four algorithms, including well-documented adverse reactions listed on the drug label, such as hypotension, hyperkalemia, peripheral edema, and dizziness. In addition, previously unmentioned potential AEs were identified, including nasopharyngitis, ear discomfort, renal pain, and musculoskeletal chest pain. The median time to onset of sparsentan-associated AEs was 18\u00a0days (IQR 4-60.5\u00a0days), with most events occurring within the first month of treatment. This study provides real-world data on the clinical application of sparsentan and analyzes the AEs associated with its use. It not only confirms several known adverse effects, but also identifies potential new AEs. These findings offer valuable guidance for clinicians prescribing sparsentan, aiding in the reduction of drug-related risks.","37":"Optogenetic vision-restorative approaches have entered the clinical stage of development. This article provides an overview of the current status of translation. It discusses specific aspects relating to the identification of a\u00a0suitable study group and the selection of endpoints. It also focuses on patients' expectations on this novel therapy. A narrative review article is presented. Clinicaltrials.gov lists eight different treatment studies pursuing the approach of optogenetic restoration of vision. The results from three of these have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Now that proof of concept has been successfully demonstrated in patients, future approaches must focus on restoring more complex visual perception in order to offer maximum added value. When identifying suitable patient groups, the status of retinal remodelling must be considered, as must the fact that patients with no remaining native visual impressions already benefit from a\u00a0lower functional gain. Study endpoints should be chosen so that they specifically probe the function of the optogenetic actuator and meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities for treatment approval. Optogenetics has reached the clinical development phase. Following proof of concept, the focus is now on further developing the approach so that it will also enable complex vision.","38":"Mazindol, an imidazo[2,1-a]-isoindole anorectic from the 1970s, has recently re-emerged as a candidate therapy for disorders of arousal and reward dysregulation, due to its unique multimodal receptor profile. Despite its 1999 withdrawal from US\/EU markets, off-label narcolepsy efficacy spurred immediate-release\/sustained-release (IR\/SR) development. Clinical trials demonstrate mazindol IR\/SR efficacy, reducing excessive daytime somnolence and cataplexy in narcolepsy and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) severity symptomatology, with mild adverse events (e.g., dry mouth). Preclinical studies demonstrate potent monoamine transporter inhibition (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin) with minimal dopamine release, reducing abuse liability compared with amphetamines. Novel interactions orexin-2, 5-HT<sub>1A<\/sub>, and mu-opioid receptors suggest reward modulation, low abuse potential, and utility in polydrug dependence (e.g., fentanyl-cocaine co-use). This review, covering the period 1970-2025, emphasizes the potential for repositioning mazindol, including its potential utility in managing opioid-stimulant co-dependence and attention-related disorders, and underscores its relevance for future therapeutic repurposing. Although this is a narrative review, we conducted targeted searches of PubMed, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov from this period of time, using terms including \"mazindol,\" \"narcolepsy,\" \"ADHD,\" and \"substance use disorder.\"","39":"We aimed to describe treatment patterns of patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) who progressed after receiving darolutamide in a real-world setting, and according to the standard clinical practice in Spain. This was a multicenter, observational, retrospective study conducted at the urology and oncology departments of 17 Spanish hospitals that participated in the ARAMIS trial and its rollover study. 85 patients, with a median age of 76\u00a0years, were included in the study. 49 patients (57.6%) progressed to mCRPC, with metastases located mainly in bone. Only 35 of them (71.4%) received at least one subsequent therapy. The most common first-line treatments after darolutamide were abiraterone (n\u2009=\u200922, 63%) and docetaxel (n\u2009=\u200910, 29%), with a median (IQR) treatment duration of 7.6\u00a0months (4.7, 12.7) and 4.8\u00a0months (3.8, 5.8), respectively; besides, the most frequent first-line\/second-line treatment sequences were abiraterone-docetaxel and docetaxel-cabazitaxel. In addition, only 20% of patients with bone metastases received osteoclast-targeted therapy. These real-world practice patterns suggest a lack of consensus in Spanish clinical practice for the management of patients with mCRPC, indicating that there is a need for more standardized strategies and unification of the criteria to make decisions in accordance with the recommendations of international clinical practice guidelines. Not applicable.","40":"Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a mathematical method for predicting drug pharmacokinetics based on individual physiological information, and its usefulness has been attracting attention in recent years. This study aimed to investigate and compare the extent to which PBPK models are utilized in drug package inserts in Japan, the United States, and Europe. We searched the official websites of the PMDA, FDA, and EMA to examine the number and content of drugs that mention the use of PBPK modeling as of 2024. Furthermore, we compared the consistency and detail of the descriptions between Japan, the United States, and Europe. As a result, 38 drugs in Japan listed PBPK modeling, many of which were related to drug-drug interactions. Compared with Europe, there were no complete matches and only seven partial matches, while compared with the United States, there were two complete matches and 24 partial matches. A comparison of the details of the 24 partial matches revealed a tendency for Japanese package inserts to be more detailed. PBPK model analysis has become increasingly important in recent drug development, and Japan in particular has a tendency to provide more detailed information on package inserts. This study suggests the potential for further utilization of PBPK models in the field of clinical pharmacology.","41":"No abstract available","42":"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infection worldwide, disproportionately affecting women and increasingly complicated by the rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The investigation of several approaches to treat UTIs has brought attention to the potential therapeutic benefits of probiotics, especially Lactobacillus species. Human breast milk, a unique reservoir of commensal and beneficial microbes, harbours diverse Lactobacillus strains with demonstrated antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and anti-adhesive properties. The probiotic potential of Lactobacillus strains isolated from human breast milk in the treatment and prevention of UTIs is critically examined. An overview of the clinical burden and epidemiology of UTIs, focusing on the issues related to antibiotic resistance, were discussed. Investigation of how Lactobacillus strains isolated from breast milk provides protection by the generation of antimicrobial metabolites, competition for adhesion sites, host immune response regulation, and uropathogen biofilm disintegration. The most recent data from animal models, in vitro research, and early clinical trials emphasize the potential of treatments such as vaginal formulations, oral supplements, and targeted distribution via nano-encapsulation. Significant information gaps, technological advancements, and future research initiatives were identified to convert these findings into therapies that can be used in future clinical settings. This review highlights breast milk-derived Lactobacillus as a unique and durable probiotic therapy against UTIs in the age of antibiotic resistance by combining microbiological, immunological, and translational aspects.","43":"Ramucirumab, a VEGFR-2-targeting monoclonal antibody, has been widely adopted in the treatment of various solid tumors. However, its safety profile in routine clinical practice remains incompletely understood. To address this, we examined adverse event reports associated with ramucirumab collected in the FAERS database between 2014 and 2024. Following careful deduplication, 3,435 reports were analyzed, identifying 139 Preferred Terms with significant signals across four disproportionality methods. In addition to well-established toxicities such as gastrointestinal perforation, hemorrhage, hypertension, and proteinuria, several previously underrecognized events were detected, including heart failure, chylothorax, and pseudocirrhosis. Gastrointestinal perforation events were particularly frequent and often occurred within the first three months of therapy. Temporal analyses indicated that the early treatment period is critical for the onset of severe adverse events. While the FAERS data cannot confirm causality, these findings underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring, especially during the initial phase of treatment, and highlight areas for further clinical and mechanistic investigation into the safety risks of ramucirumab.","44":"Therapeutic benefits of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroids remain inconclusive in optimizing treatment strategies for acute myocarditis. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane databases, and Web of Science were searched for studies evaluating the effectiveness of adjunctive IVIG, steroids, or both with standard heart failure treatment in pediatric acute myocarditis. A random-effects network meta-analysis was conducted using frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Effect sizes were calculated as risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD). P-scores provided a ranking of treatments. Thirteen studies comprising 2850 participants were involved. Compared with standard treatment, IVIG reduced in-hospital mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.35-0.76), long-term mortality (RR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.27-0.98), overall mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34-0.76), and better composite outcome (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88). IVIG was optimal for reducing in-hospital and overall mortality and improving the composite outcome (P-scores = 0.993, 0.999, 0.986). Steroids or their combination with IVIG showed no significant benefit. IVIG improved cardiac function by increasing left ventricular ejection fraction (MD, 6.00%; 95% CI, 0.94-11.06) and reducing left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (MD, -3.77; 95% CI, -7.02 to -0.52). Integrating IVIG into standard treatment may significantly enhance outcomes in children with complicated acute myocarditis. This systematic review and network meta-analysis addresses the gap between clinical trial efficacy and real-world effectiveness in pediatric clinical practice. This study suggests that adding IVIG to standard heart failure therapy may improve survival and cardiac function in children with acute complicated myocarditis. The routine use of steroids requires the cautious clinical application. High-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to inform guidelines and optimize therapy.","45":"Mucus hypersecretion and accumulation are hallmark features of equine asthma (EA), a meaningful respiratory disorder in horses occurring in mild to moderate (MEA) and severe (SEA) forms. Changes of the proteomic composition of airway mucus in EA are poorly understood. Using label-free quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we analyzed airway mucus from SEA (n\u2009=\u200910), MEA (n\u2009=\u20096), and healthy (n\u2009=\u20098) horses. We identified and quantified 2,275 proteins including gel-forming mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B and membrane-bound mucins MUC1 and MUC4. Compared with healthy controls, 130 proteins (SEA) and 103 (MEA) were significantly increased. 38 were elevated in SEA relative to MEA, 10 were higher in MEA. MUC4 was markedly increased in both, correlated with bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.790, p\u2009=\u20094.9E-06), and distinguished excellently between healthy and asthmatics (AUC\u2009=\u20091.0, 95% CI: 1-1), similar to 23 other proteins. MUC5AC was elevated in both, whereas MUC5B only in SEA. MUC1 did not differ between groups. Changes in mucus-modifying proteins, including glycosyltransferases and aquaporins, suggest altered mucus properties in EA. Functional enrichment analyses revealed inflammation-, tissue remodeling- and coagulation-linked GO terms and pathways in EA. The distinct proteomic profiles add to the understanding of EA and may offer novel targets for phenotype-specific biomarkers and therapy.","46":"Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are over-represented in psychiatric services, and their suicide mortality is markedly higher than that of the general population. This network meta-analysis evaluated and compared the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for symptoms of BPD. A systematic search of Medline\u00ae, Web of Science\u00ae, and Google Scholar\u00ae identified randomised clinical trials comparing active drugs with placebo or another agent between 15 January and 12 February 2024. Standardised mean differences were estimated using random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses. The level of evidence (LoE) for significant drug-placebo comparisons was rated using GRADE NMA guidance. Thirty-five trials including 2551 participants assessed 26 treatments against placebo: 18 had low, five moderate, and 12 high risk of bias. Topiramate (200-250\u2009mg\/day, 8-10 weeks), lamotrigine (50-200\u2009mg\/day, 8 weeks), and aripiprazole (15\u2009mg\/day, 8 weeks) most effectively reduced hostility, aggressiveness, and anger, and improved anger control. Carbamazepine (200-1200\u2009mg\/ day, 6 weeks) and asenapine (5-10\u2009mg\/day, 12 weeks) improved impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, respectively. Topiramate, lamotrigine, and aripiprazole demonstrated high, moderate, and moderate LoE for hostility and anger reduction. Carbamazepine and asenapine demonstrated low and very low LoE for impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. Conversely, alprazolam, methylphenidate, haloperidol, and valproate had only low-certainty evidence in unselected BPD samples and should not be prioritised. Prescription should be limited to specific, individualised indications, such as panic, comorbid ADHD, or transient psychotic features, following cautious clinical appraisal.","47":"Subthreshold depression (StD) confers a high risk for major depression and is characterized by substantial individual clinical heterogeneity. However, the neurobiological substrates underlying this heterogeneity remain largely unknown. Using a large multisite resting-state functional MRI dataset including 1203 healthy participants and 197 individuals with StD, we constructed connectome-based normative models to identify individual brain deviations and biotypes in StD. We highlighted remarkable individual variability in the connectome deviations in StD, leading to the identification of two distinct biotypes. Subtype 1 exhibits severe positive deviations primarily in the default mode regions and negative deviations in the sensorimotor and ventral attention areas, while subtype 2 shows a moderate but opposite deviation pattern. The two subtypes differ significantly in depressive symptoms, gene expression profiles, and treatment responses to bright light therapy. These findings highlight the neurobiological underpinnings of the clinical diversity in StD, emphasizing the necessity for developing personalized interventions for this condition.","48":"No abstract available","49":"No abstract available","50":"Anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have changed the treatment landscape of many advanced malignancies. However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) bring great challenges to clinical benefits. The prediction of irAEs is urgently demanded for early detection and intervention. Patients in our center who received anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy between January 2019 and May 2023 were collected. Logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis with 10-fold cross-validation was performed to identify the most relevant variables associated with irAEs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to build a prediction model by introducing features selected in LASSO regression analysis. Overall, 680 eligible patients were included, of whom 330 patients were included in the irAEs group. In the irAEs group, 455 different irAEs were reported, of which 52 events were grade 3 or higher in severity. Endocrinal toxicities (174\/680, 25.59%) were the most commonly reported irAEs. Through LASSO and logistic regression analysis, we developed a risk assessment model to predict the risk of irAEs based on basophil percentage (BASO%), hemoglobin (Hb), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), blood urea nitrogen level (BUN), the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), and hepatitis B\/hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. The model had a C-index of 0.727, with good discrimination and calibration capabilities. The prediction model developed in our study can screen and monitor patients with high risk of developing irAEs. It may improve prognosis for pan-cancer patients receiving anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy.","51":"No abstract available","52":"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) are approved to treat IBD, but there are concerns over whether they increase the risk of MACE or venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with IBD. We aimed to compare the incidence risk of MACE and VTE in patients with IBD treated with JAKi agents versus anti-TNFs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database to identify patients \u2009\u2265\u200918\u00a0years with IBD and treated with JAKi or anti-TNF therapy. Patients in the JAKi cohort were matched with patients treated with anti-TNF by using 1:1 propensity score matching. Patients with a history of a prior cardiovascular event were excluded from the analysis. Co-primary outcomes were MACE and VTE within 1-year after medication initiation. Additional subgroup analyses were performed based on age, sex, and IBD type. Kaplan-Meier analysis with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were used to compare time-to-event rates. In total, there were 8942 patients in the JAKi cohort matched with 8942 patients in the anti-TNF cohort. There was no difference between the two cohorts in the development of MACE (aHR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.87-1.33; p\u2009=\u20090.49) or VTE (aHR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.84-1.36; p\u2009=\u20090.61). In patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years, there was no statistically significant difference between the two cohorts in MACE outcomes (aHR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.69-1.31; p\u2009=\u20090.75). Consistent findings were observed when comparing ulcerative colitis to Crohn's disease, upadacitinib to tofacitinib, or JAKi to infliximab. Our results suggest that patients with IBD, including patients\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years, who are treated with JAKi, were not at increased risk of MACE or VTE over a 12-month period as compared to those treated with anti-TNF therapy. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.","53":"In vitro permeation testing (IVPT) is a method widely used to assess the skin permeation profiles of topical drug products for product development and regulatory evaluation. Various skin models serve as diffusion barriers in IVPT, including surgically excised human skin (EHS) and human cadaver skin (HCS). Limited EHS supply has led to the use of HCS in IVPT, but HCS shows variable skin permeation among donors, creating challenges in obtaining consistent results. To address these supply and variability issues, this study evaluated the potential of reconstructed human skin (RHS) as an alternative diffusion barrier for IVPT. Sunscreen (cream) permeation through four skin models were compared, including two HCS models and two RHS models with or without dermal layers. Among the tested skin models, EpiDermFT (RHS with dermal layers) exhibited consistent results for both intra-batch and inter-batch permeation. Additionally, EpiDermFT exhibited similar rank order of cumulative permeation compared to the HCS counterpart, whereas EpiDerm (RHS without dermal layers) exhibited greater sensitivity to pH changes in cream formulations than HCS models. These findings suggest that EpiDermFT has potential utility as a reliable alternative that provides comparable permeation results to HCS, whereas EpiDerm may serve as a sensitive tool to detect pH differences in topical formulations. However, to determine the broader applicability of RHS in IVPT, further investigations using diverse topical formulations across different dosage forms are necessary.","54":"To describe the use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the diagnosis of cardiac herniation following pneumonectomy, a serious complication that requires rapid recognition and management to prevent death. We present a case report of a 65-yr-old man referred for right intrapericardial pneumonectomy in the context of a right lower lobe lung cancer invading the hilum following induction targeted therapy. At the end of surgery, the patient's trachea was successfully extubated and the vital signs were stable. On preparation to exit the operating room, the patient's blood pressure (BP) suddenly dropped, and he became pale and unconscious. Chest compressions were rapidly initiated, and the patient's trachea was reintubated. Return of spontaneous circulation was obtained after 3\u2009min of resuscitation. A TEE probe was quickly inserted, and the examination showed hyperdynamic right and left ventricles with the apex of the heart oriented towards the right side of the patient instead of the usual left. In addition, the right atrium was partially collapsed, and a redundant wall and a mass effect were seen at the level of the interatrial septum. These images strongly suggested that the heart had twisted on its longitudinal axis, leading to a torsion of the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and right atrium-consistent with a cardiac strangulation or herniation. The surgical team reopened the patient urgently, the heart was repositioned in the pericardium, and the pericardial defect was closed with a GORE-TEX\u00ae patch. The postoperative course was uneventful. Transesophageal echocardiography can be useful in diagnosing cardiac herniation following pneumonectomy.","55":"A growing number of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have been developed and investigated in clinical studies, with several FDA-approved therapies targeting CD19 and BCMA antigens on hematological malignancies. To further expand the indication to solid tumors and autoimmune diseases, a new generation of CAR T-cell therapies has been investigated to explore new tumor-associated antigens, allogeneic options, and cytokine armoring strategies, etc. to overcome the current limitations, including safety concerns, relapse rates, tumor microenvironment challenges, patient accessibility and manufacturing complexities. Cellular kinetics and biodistribution assessments are crucial in understanding the efficacy and safety of cell therapy, as a living drug that typically exhibits four distinct phases: distribution, expansion, contraction, and persistence within the body. Droplet digital PCR has emerged as the technology of choice in cell and gene therapy for transgene quantification with higher sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and absolute quantification, and as an end-point PCR provides higher tolerance to PCR inhibition. In the meantime, several unique challenges remain to be addressed in the cellular kinetics and biodistribution studies of CAR T, depending on the program stage, types of immune cells, and target indication (hematological and solid tumors, autoimmune). This opinion paper discusses the challenges and considerations of PCR-based cellular kinetics and biodistribution assessment to support emerging adoptive cell therapy programs.","56":"The dual crises of antimicrobial resistance and cancer demand innovative therapeutic platforms that overcome conventional treatment limitations. This study uniquely combines systematic Box-Behnken optimization of green-synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles from Thymus vulgaris with comprehensive evaluation of their synergistic antimicrobial and anticancer activities. HPLC profiling identified quercetin (55.92%), chlorogenic acid (15.33%), and gallic acid (12.28%) as principal phytochemical reducing and capping agents. Statistical optimization (R<sup>2<\/sup>\u2009=\u20090.9886) established copper acetate concentration (F\u2009=\u2009670.48, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and incubation time (F\u2009=\u2009124.11, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) as critical synthesis determinants, yielding monodisperse spherical nanoparticles (19-25 nm TEM; Z-average 119.2 nm, PDI 0.22; \u03b6-potential\u2009-\u200945.8 mV). XRD confirmed a crystalline monoclinic CuO phase, while FTIR validated phytochemical surface functionalization. TE-CuONPs exhibited concentration-dependent bactericidal activity (MIC 250-950 \u03bcg\/mL; MBC\/MIC\u2009\u2264\u20090.58) against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis as well as inhibition of biofilm formation in\u00a0S. aureus\u00a0and\u00a0P. aeruginosa, with BIC\u2085\u2080 of 299 and 315 \u03bcg\/mL, respectively. Critically, checkerboard assays revealed strong synergy with gentamicin (FICI 0.13-0.28), achieving eightfold dose reduction for both agents against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Time-kill kinetics demonstrated accelerated bacterial eradication, with combination therapy achieving\u2009\u2265\u20093-log\u2081\u2080 reduction 8-12 h faster than monotherapies, a clinically significant advantage for acute infections. Furthermore, TE-CuONPs showed moderate antiproliferative activity (IC\u2085\u2080\u2009=\u2009117.26 \u03bcg\/mL) against MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with limited selectivity over normal fibroblasts (SI\u2009=\u20091.85), representing a sixfold enhancement over the crude extract. Additionally, Flow cytometric analysis revealed profound apoptotic induction, with 77.25% of cancer cells undergoing cell death (29.73% early apoptosis, 47.52% late apoptosis\/necrosis). DPPH radical scavenging (IC\u2085\u2080\u2009=\u200955 \u03bcg\/mL) demonstrated a threefold superior antioxidant capacity versus plant extract alone. These findings advance the reproducible botanical nanoparticle synthesis and translational potential of plant-mediated nanomedicine for infectious disease management.","57":"The decline in estrogen following menopause is a major driver of metabolic and immune dysfunction in aging females. While hormone replacement therapy improves many of these outcomes, its clinical use remains limited due to concerns regarding estrogen-sensitive malignancies. Tissue-selective estrogen complexes (TSECs), which combine estrogens with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen (TAM), represent a promising strategy to preserve the metabolic and immunological benefits of estrogen while reducing oncogenic risk. However, the systemic effects of TAM under conditions of estrogen deficiency remain incompletely defined. In this study, we investigated the metabolic and immunomodulatory actions of low-dose TAM, alone or in combination with 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), in adult ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. OVX resulted in increased adiposity, hepatic steatosis, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) concentration, and systemic inflammation, along with decreased immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) concentration. E2, TAM, and E2\u2009+\u2009TAM each attenuated OVX-induced adipose expansion, adipocyte hypertrophy, and proinflammatory cytokine production. TAM improved insulin sensitivity but did not fully restore glucose tolerance. Transcriptomic analysis of visceral adipose tissue-resident B cells revealed that E2 and E2\u2009+\u2009TAM modulate overlapping yet distinct immune-regulatory networks, including suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling, regulation of immune checkpoints, and genes linked to adipose homeostasis. Low-dose TAM emerges as a modulator of estrogen receptor signaling that attenuates multiple features of OVX-induced metabolic and inflammatory dysfunction, though its limited effect on glycemic control highlights the need for tissue-specific evaluation of SERM-based interventions. These findings provide mechanistic insight into endocrine-immune-metabolic interactions and inform strategies to reduce aging-related disease risk in postmenopausal women.","58":"Glioma therapy often fails due to the acquisition of temozolomide (TMZ) resistance. Antiepileptic drugs, valproic acid (VPA) and levetiracetam (LEV) are commonly used during the perioperative period of glioma patients, and have been proposed for repurposing to augment TMZ efficacy. Our previous studies revealed that LEV could increase TMZ efficacy through downregulation of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and VPA could promote glioma cells apoptosis. Recently, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been considered as important modulators of TMZ resistance. As for LEV or VPA, which one is better to improve TMZ efficacy for macrophage-rich gliomas remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether VPA or LEV could mitigate macrophage-mediated exceptional TMZ resistance. Our in vitro experiments revealed that VPA rather than LEV could polarize TAMs into M1 phenotypes. In vivo, glioma mouse models could benefit more from TMZ\u2009+\u2009VPA regimen by increasing intratumoral M1 macrophage infiltration. We conclude that VPA might be more useful than LEV to improve the therapeutic effect of TMZ for macrophage-rich gliomas. This study provides critical preclinical evidence for the optimal selection of the antiepileptic drug to overcome TAM-mediated chemoresistance, offering translational implications for personalized therapeutic strategies for macrophage-rich gliomas.","59":"Cross-validating bioanalytical assays between laboratories is challenging, and antidrug antibody (ADA) assays are particularly difficult to cross-validate due to the lack of regulatory guidance specific to this topic. As a result, different companies have adopted varying approaches. Currently, bioanalytical practices for ADA assay cross-validation are not harmonized. Therefore, it is important to share individual company experiences and practices to facilitate harmonization for industry standards. This manuscript presents Boehringer Ingelheim's strategy and practice, referred to as a \"data-driven stepwise approach,\" for clinical ADA assay cross-validation. In Step 1, the ADA assay is first validated at the reference laboratory and then qualified at the comparator laboratory. In Step 2, both laboratories demonstrate comparable responses through cut-point evaluation, confirmed by statistical analysis. In Step 3, identical blinded test samples are analyzed at both laboratories to confirm consistent classification of results as ADA-negative or ADA-positive. Upon satisfactory completion of these steps, the ADA assay is considered successfully cross-validated from the reference laboratory to the comparator laboratory. Case studies are also presented.","60":"The anchor-pronged clip has been widely adopted for closure of large defects, offering enhanced tensile strength and grasping ability. However, reported real-world device and patient adverse events are limited in literature. Our focus is to identify the most commonly reported adverse events, device issues, and their clinical implications. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was analyzed from February 1, 2023 to December 31, 2024 to report post-marketing surveillance data on these anchor pronged clips. Approximately 135 reported cases with 187 device issues and 30 patient adverse events were examined. The most reported device problems were due to activation, position, or separation (53.5%). Common indications included defect closures after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) (29.9%) and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) (23.9%). From the total reports analyzed, patient adverse events were noted in 21.1% (n\u2009\u00a0=\u00a0\u200930) of cases which comprised of hemorrhage (43.3%; n\u2009\u00a0=\u00a0\u200913), perforation (10.0%; n\u2009\u00a0=\u00a0\u20093), abdominal pain (6.7%; n\u2009\u00a0=\u00a0\u20092) among others. Our analysis of the MAUDE database suggests that the MANTIS<sup>\u2122<\/sup> clip demonstrates a favorable safety profile, particularly considering its intended use for closing large defects after advance tissue resections and ulcerations - procedures that inherently carry a higher risk of complications. This study provides valuable insight to help inform the risk\/benefit discussions with patients and guide the development of future design iterations, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and safety.","61":"No abstract available","62":"No abstract available","63":"No abstract available","64":"The comparative effectiveness of different hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy doses in the acute treatment of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) has not been evaluated. This retrospective cohort study aimed to compare the efficacy of an initial 2.8<sub>ATA<\/sub> HBO session (HBO18) to the more prevalent 2.0<sub>ATA<\/sub> protocol (HBO10). Excluded were patients with suspected inflammatory arteritis or branch retinal artery occlusion, and when HBO was medically contraindicated. Following the initial session, all patients completed two additional HBO10 sessions within 24\u2009h. The primary outcome was the change in best corrected visual acuity (\u0394BCVA) within 24\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009h. Safety outcomes included neurological events suggestive of central oxygen toxicity and barotrauma-related symptoms. Improvement in \u0394BCVA was significantly greater in the HBO18 group (median 0.62 LogMAR, mean -0.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73) compared with the HBO10 group (median 0.22 LogMAR, mean -0.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.40, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Adverse events were similar in incidence between the treatment groups, with no severe occurrences necessitating the discontinuation of HBO reported. In multivariate analysis, HBO18 use was associated with a 0.5 LogMAR improvement in BCVA at 24\u2009h (95% CI 0.3-0.7, p\u2009<\u20090.001), with greater initial BCVA impairment and shorter time to HBO further associated with better outcomes (0.20 LogMAR, 95% CI 0.08-0.31, p\u2009=\u20090.001; and 0.04 LogMAR\/hour, 95% CI 0.02-0.04, p\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively). HBO18 as the initial therapy for CRAO seems to be associated with better short-term improvement in BCVA, compared with HBO10.","65":"To determine the long-term effect of the administration of topical anti-glaucoma medications on Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) efficacy and to identify other potential risk factors for failure of SLT. A single-centre, observational cohort study of 264 SLT procedures performed on 127 patients over a 10-year period. Data collected included the absolute number of anti-glaucoma drops administered, intraocular pressure (IOP) and the number of anti-glaucoma medications at each visit. A Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to analyse various risk factors. A multivariate logistic regression model for failure in the first 12 months was constructed to adjust for potential confounders, including age, pre-SLT IOP, treatment duration, disease duration, total number of pre-SLT drops administered and SLT energy delivered. A greater number of pre-SLT drop administrations was identified as a risk factor for failure of SLT. At 12 months, the complete success rate of SLT for eyes unexposed to drops was 62%, for those to a moderate number of drops, 36-41% and for those to a high number of drops, only 2%. Other statistically significant risk factors included duration of drop therapy, exposure to drop preservatives, disease duration, age, previous cataract surgery, lower pre-SLT IOP and a lower SLT energy level. Long-term exposure to topical anti-glaucoma medication (especially if preserved), longer duration of disease and therapy, together with older age and prior cataract surgery, may all have a significant adverse effect on SLT outcome.","66":"The transition from advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) to kidney failure requires comprehensive management to optimize patient outcomes. This crucial period, in practical terms defined by CKD stages G4 and G5, involves complex decision-making regarding kidney replacement therapy, pre-emptive kidney transplantation and conservative kidney management. Patient preferences, quality of life, and comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease, are essential considerations when making treatment decisions. Importantly, nephroprotective therapies should be continued even at advanced stages of CKD to stabilize kidney function and prevent cardiovascular events. Pre-emptive kidney transplantation, when feasible, offers the best outcomes and should be prioritized. Dialysis initiation should be based on clinical symptoms and shared decision-making with the patient, rather than laboratory values alone. For some, particularly older, patients with substantial comorbidities, conservative kidney management, emphasizing symptom management without kidney replacement therapy, might be preferred. Considerable disparities in access to care exist globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries, highlighting the need for tailored strategies. Registry and cohort studies have provided most of the scientific understanding in this area, but more randomized clinical trials are needed to guide advanced CKD management.","67":"With increasing survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), long-term toxicities have become a critical aspect. A novel measure, designated Severe Toxicity-free survival (STFS), was developed through international consensus to integrate the most severe, symptomatic organ toxicities in outcome evaluation. This measure has not been applied to real-world data before. We assessed the incidence of 21 predefined Severe Toxicities in a nationwide cohort of 506 ALL patients aged 1-45 years treated according to the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol. At five years, event-free survival was 84.4% (95% CI: 81.3-87.7%) and Severe Toxicity-event-free survival was 78.4% (95% CI: 74.9-82.1%), with significantly lower values in adults (aged 18-45 years) than children (61.6% [52.6-72.2%] vs 82.4% [78.8-86.2%]; log-rank p\u2009<\u20090.001). The most common Severe Toxicities were severe osteonecrosis limiting activities of daily function (N\u2009=\u200920) and disabling paralytic and neuropathic conditions (N\u2009=\u200916). Exploratory analyses showed that 10-17-year-olds had the highest risk of Severe Toxicities similar to that of adults. These findings highlight a burden of severe, long-term toxicities in ALL survivors overlooked by traditional outcome measures, also following frontline therapy only. STFS should be incorporated in future trials for meaningful outcome evaluation and international comparisons across treatment strategies.","68":"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) evokes antitumor immunity through the reinvigoration of T\u2009cell responses. T\u2009cell differentiation status controls response, with less differentiated cells having an enhanced capacity to proliferate after ICB. Given that conventional type\u20091 dendritic cells (cDC1) maintain precursor exhausted T\u2009cells (T<sub>PEX<\/sub>), we hypothesized that expansion of cDC1s with Flt3L could enhance responses to ICB. Here we show that treatment with Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) expands CD62L<sup>+<\/sup>SLAMF6<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T\u2009cells in the tumor through a mechanism that requires XCR1<sup>+<\/sup> dendritic cells to traffic to the tumor-draining lymph node. The combination of Flt3L and anti-CTLA-4 enhanced therapeutic responses. Combination therapy is associated with the emergence of a CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T\u2009cell subset characterized by the expression of Il21r and oligoclonal expansion of CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T\u2009cells within tumors through a mechanism that is dependent on lymph node egress.","69":"Hyperthermia therapy is a developing adjuvant oncologic technique that induces controlled heating (40-45\u00a0\u00b0C) in the affected area to enhance the therapeutic effect of radiation or chemotherapy, while avoiding damage to surrounding healthy tissue. In this work, a 16-element circularly polarized microstrip antenna array operating at 2.45\u00a0GHz is proposed to improve the accuracy and safety of electromagnetic hyperthermia treatment. Localization of the target is performed using image-based clustering. A particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based phase-only approach is used to optimize the beamformer weights for maximum power deposition at the tumor location. Hotspot suppression is performed using a Null Space Jacobian (NSJ)-based method to mitigate superficial heating after target localization and power optimization. This adaptive control is executed in a near real-time manner during treatment delivery, with a total closed-loop update time below 1.5\u00a0s. Simulation studies using a full-wave electromagnetic solver coupled with a bioheat model verify accurate power focusing, minimal energy leakage, and improved thermal safety. Phantom-based experimental validation further demonstrates uniform heating and effective suppression of non-target temperature rise. The proposed system demonstrates a hybrid intelligent approach for improving treatment efficacy and has strong potential for further development as an adaptive prototype verified through phantom experiments.","70":"Positive ascites cytology is a known poor prognostic factor in ovarian cancer, but its impact after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with complete tumor resection remains unclear. Among 4944 patients, 191 underwent primary debulking surgery (PDS) and 59 underwent NAC followed by interval debulking surgery (NAC-IDS), all achieving R0 resection at stage III. Kaplan-Meier, univariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. Positive ascites cytology was independently associated with higher recurrence and mortality at 5\u00a0years [odds ratio (OR) of recurrence at 5\u00a0years\u2009=\u20092.412, P\u2009=\u20090.003; OR of mortality at 5\u00a0years\u2009=\u20092.025, P\u2009=\u20090.010]. Subgroup analysis showed greater risk in NAC-IDS than in PDS [NAC-IDS: HR of PFS\u2009=\u20092.003, P\u2009=\u20090.029; HR of OS\u2009=\u20093.259, P\u2009=\u20090.006; PDS: HR of PFS\u2009=\u20091.549, P\u2009=\u20090.031; HR of OS\u2009=\u20091.789, P\u2009=\u20090.018]. The interaction effect analysis suggested that positive ascites cytology was associated with a higher risk of mortality at 5\u00a0years in NAC patients than in PDS patients [OR of NAC-IDS\u2009=\u20093.722, OR of PDS\u2009=\u20091.151, OR for interaction\u2009=\u20093.234]. The present results indicate that positive ascites cytology in NAC-IDS predicts poor survival outcomes in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.","71":"Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a developmental disorder frequently linked to drug-resistant focal epilepsy, where surgical intervention is often the most promising treatment. Unfortunately, conventional neuroradiological methods often struggle to detect subtle FCD cases, which may result in missed surgical opportunities for patients. To address this challenge, we have developed an innovative approach to FCD lesions detection using conditional diffusion models guided by complementary location-based modal factors. Our method involves employing a classifier to identify epileptic sites while directing the diffusion model to generate pseudo-healthy images. Using the unique features of FCD present in both T1 and FLAIR images, T1 images conditions the diffusion model to produce the corresponding FLAIR image, effectively removing abnormal tissue. Recognizing the difficulty in detecting epileptic lesions due to their subtle presentation, we have incorporated histogram matching techniques to address the color distortion issues commonly associated with diffusion models. This adjustment ensures that chromatic aberration does not hinder the identification of lesions. The effectiveness of our method has been validated using the UHB FCD MRI dataset, achieving an image-level recall metric of 0.952 and a pixel-level dice metric of 0.245. These results surpass those obtained from four other comparative methods, underscoring the superior performance of our approach. Our code is available at https:\/\/github.com\/CodePYJ\/FCD-Detection.","72":"Canine leishmaniosis (CanL), caused by Leishmania infantum, is primarily controlled by a Th1-type immune response. Cyclosporin A (CsA) and oclacitinib (Oc) are commonly used immunomodulatory drugs which might affect the immune response of dogs making them more susceptible to developing clinical leishmaniosis. This study aimed to evaluate, ex vivo, the effects of CsA and Oc on the production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-17a, and IL-2 measured by ELISA in response to L. infantum soluble antigen (LSA). Dogs were divided into three groups: healthy seronegative non-IFN-\u03b3 producers (group 1, n\u2009=\u200911), healthy seronegative\/seropositive IFN-\u03b3 producers (group 2, n\u2009=\u20099), and clinically affected seropositive IFN-\u03b3 producers (group 3, n\u2009=\u200910). Whole blood assays were stimulated with LSA, Concanavalin A (ConA), or culture medium, in the presence or absence of CsA (200 ng\/mL) or Oc (168.5 and 337 ng\/mL). CsA significantly reduced the production of all three cytokines in response to both LSA and ConA in groups 2 and 3, and after ConA stimulation in all groups. Oc at 337 ng\/mL significantly decreased IFN-\u03b3 production only in group 3 after LSA stimulation. In conclusion, CsA broadly suppresses proinflammatory cytokine responses to L. infantum, while Oc shows a more limited effect, reducing IFN-\u03b3 only in clinically affected dogs.","73":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by the presence of marked, neutrophil-dominant inflammation that contributes to tissue injury and the development of irreversible structural lung disease. Here, we describe a dysregulated, neutrophil-dominant inflammation and an accompanying pro-inflammatory airway epithelium in the pediatric CF lung through the application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to minimally invasive respiratory specimens collected during flexible bronchoscopy. These findings were present in both an infant and an adolescent with CF, the latter on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy, suggesting a common pathological program that starts early in life and may be challenging to reverse once structural lung disease is established. Intercellular communication network analysis further revealed potential mechanisms whereby airway epithelial cells modulate the ongoing, destructive airway inflammation present in the CF lung. Importantly, the scRNA-seq workflow leveraged in this study provides a unique opportunity to investigate and monitor disease-related changes in the composition, function, and interaction of the immune and airway epithelial cell populations in CF and other respiratory diseases across the life course.","74":"Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane (THP) has been the standard first-line therapy for HER2+ advanced breast cancer for over a decade. With new regimens emerging, genomic tools like HER2DX may help identify patients who benefit durably from THP versus those requiring intensification. Here, baseline tumor tissue from 122 patients with HER2+ treated with THP in Poland was tested with HER2DX. A previously published Spanish real-world cohort (n\u2009=\u200993) was added to generate a combined cohort (n\u2009=\u2009215). Univariable analyses were performed in the Polish cohort, and multivariable Cox and logistic regression models were applied to the combined cohort. A HER2DX metastatic prognostic score was trained on overall survival (OS) in the Spanish cohort and validated in the Polish cohort. In the Polish cohort, high ERBB2 mRNA scores were associated with significantly longer real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) (33.8 vs. 17.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.57; p\u2009=\u20090.022) and real-world overall survival (rwOS) (75.1 vs. 40.2; HR 0.48; p\u2009=\u20090.009). In the combined cohort, ERBB2 high-score tumors showed prolonged rwPFS (33.8 vs. 12.5; HR 0.50; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and rwOS (not reached vs. 37.1; HR 0.36; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and higher rwORR (84.4% vs. 52.0%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Prognostic value was independent of clinical variables, including number of metastatic sites. Subgroup analyses showed particularly favorable outcomes in patients with <3 sites (median rwPFS 51.7 vs. 20.3 months). The HER2DX metastatic prognostic score outperformed ERBB2 alone in the validation cohort. In conclusion, the HER2DX ERBB2 mRNA score provides independent prognostic information in HER2+ advanced breast cancer treated with THP. The HER2DX metastatic prognostic score further improves prognostic accuracy.","75":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a leading cause of death and disability globally, often results in functional impairments due to complex pathological mechanisms and limited therapeutic options. Recently, astrocytes, the most abundant glia in the central nervous system, have been recognized as therapeutic targets for TBI due to their roles in neuroinflammation and neuroprotection. While NeuroD1-based gene therapy demonstrates therapeutic potential by reversing glial scar, suppressing neuroinflammation, and repairing brain tissue, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. To elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing using cortical stab injury mice of TBI to compare the effects of vehicle treatment with those of NeuroD1-based gene therapy. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals significant shifts in cellular composition and astrocyte subtypes. These changes involve upregulated synaptic assembly and myelination pathways alongside downregulated mitochondrial and metabolic functions in TBI mice. Conversely, NeuroD1-based gene therapy restores mitochondrial and metabolic functions and attenuates aberrant synaptic and myelination processes. This single-cell transcriptomic dataset provided a valuable resource for mechanistic and therapeutic research for TBI.","76":"People with HIV (PWH) on combination antiretroviral therapy have an elevated risk for aging-related non-AIDS comorbidities. We assess whether HIV infection accelerates biological aging in two independent cohorts of PWH using six organ-specific and three organism-wide aging clocks derived from plasma proteomics of healthy individuals. Proteomic age acceleration significantly correlates with DNA methylation age and is linked to comorbidities and mortality. HIV infection accelerates systemic biological aging, with Mendelian randomization demonstrating causality between organ aging and inflammatory or metabolic complications. Accelerated aging in PWH is further related to the total HIV reservoir, and specific antiretroviral drugs reduce age acceleration. These data reveal important causal effects between chronic HIV infection, antiretroviral medication, biological aging and age-associated diseases, highlighting targets for improving health span in PWH.","77":"Curing tuberculosis (TB) remains challenging due to treatment complexity and high recurrence rates. Through bioinformatic analyses of the immune microenvironment within clinical non-tuberculous granulomas (NTBG)\/tuberculous granulomas (TBG) samples, and peripheral blood from drug-resistant\/sensitive, recurrent\/non-recurrent TB patients, we identify suppression of innate immune responses, especially downregulated Toll-like receptor\/NF-kappa B pathways in macrophages\/dendritic cells and elevated B\/T cell negative regulation, contributing to treatment failure and recurrence. Building on these insights, we develop mannose-modified organic semiconducting nano-immunostimulants (<sup>man<\/sup>SNI) for precise TB sono-immunotherapy. Under optimized ultrasound condition, <sup>man<\/sup>SNI generates massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) to eradicate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) within lung granulomas\/macrophages, while simultaneously promoting in situ release of M.tb-derived antigens. The released antigens and TLR7 agonist R837 synergistically induce potent innate\/adaptive anti-TB immunity and long-lasting immune memory. This granulomas microenvironment-guided sono-immunotherapy strategy demonstrates efficient TB control and relapse\/reinfection prevention, which provides a promising direction for customized therapy against high-pathogenic infections.","78":"Core fucosylation, catalyzed by fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8), plays critical roles in cancer progression, immune evasion, and drug resistance, making it a compelling therapeutic target. However, development of selective FUT8 inhibitors has been hindered by shared substrate specificity of fucosyltransferases. Here, we report the discovery of a previously unrecognized allosteric site on FUT8 and the development of a low-toxicity covalent inhibitor, CAIF (stearic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-dimethylimidazolium bromide), through structure-based drug design. High-throughput screening and crystallographic studies reveal that small molecules such as NH125 bind to a channel-like allosteric pocket, inducing conformational changes that disrupt FUT8 activity. Leveraging these insights, we design CAIF to covalently target lysine K216 within the allosteric site. CAIF exhibits minimal cytotoxicity and significantly inhibits core fucosylation and cancer cell invasion in cellular assays. This work establishes CAIF as a lead compound for further optimization and development, offering a framework for targeting glycosyltransferases through allosteric and covalent inhibition strategies.","79":"No abstract available","80":"In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cisplatin is known to be associated with poor treatment compliance and notable side effects. More effective and safer platinum drugs are needed for the treatment of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In 2021, our multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial reported that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy resulted in non-inferior survival and fewer toxic effects than did cisplatin-based therapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Data from the 10-year survival analysis are updated here. With a median follow-up of 10.6 years in the intention-to-treat population, 10-year progression-free survival is 70.7% in the lobaplatin-based therapy group vs. 71.9% in the cisplatin-based therapy group (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.72-1.43; log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.885). The difference between the groups is 1.2% (95% CI -6.7-9.1, p<sub>non-inferiority<\/sub>\u2009=\u20090.015), which is lower than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. The results are similar when we analyze patients in the per-protocol population. In the univariable and multivariable analyses, stage is an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (p\u2009=\u20090.001). The subgroup analyses suggest that the non-inferiority of lobaplatin-based therapy did not differ among specific populations. The incidence of late toxic effects is similar between the therapy groups, except\u00a0for grades 1-2 peripheral neuropathy (p\u2009=\u20090.033), grades 1-2 deafness\/otitis (p\u2009=\u20090.021), and grades 1-2\/3 nephrotoxicity (p\u2009=\u20090.005; p\u2009=\u20090.021), the incidence of which is greater in the cisplatin-based therapy group than in the lobaplatin-based therapy group. Our findings suggest that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus lobaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an alternative doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","81":"Bacteriophage-antibiotic coadministration is increasingly used for refractory infections, yet the in vivo interactions among phages, bacteria, antibiotics, and host immunity remain poorly defined. We report a longitudinal, multiomic case analysis of a male in his seventies with cystic fibrosis (CF) experiencing an acute-on-chronic pulmonary exacerbation caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After colistin discontinuation due to nephrotoxicity, ciprofloxacin was initiated, with an intravenous two-phage cocktail introduced days later. Distinct mucoid and nonmucoid bacterial subpopulations associated differentially with antibiotic versus phage exposure, consistent with nonoverlapping selective pressures. Phage activity was temporally constrained, with one phage dominating early bacterial and genomic signals before attenuating after approximately seven days, despite continued genomic detectability. In contrast, the second phage showed no evidence of productive activity. This asymmetry coincided with phage-reactive humoral immunity: pre-existing IgM was associated with lack of recoverability of one phage, while treatment-associated IgM emergence temporally tracked attenuation of the dominant phage. Although phage-resistant variants arose during therapy, they showed limited expansion relative to susceptible populations. These findings define a mechanistic framework-chemobiotherapy-in which chemical and biological antimicrobials coordinate through ecological and immunologic complementarity rather than direct pharmacologic synergy.","82":"Pyroptosis plays a crucial role in immune defense against infections and endogenous threats by eliminating harmful cells and modulating the immune response through inflammation. However, the natural activation of pyroptosis involves intricate signaling pathways, posing significant challenges for its artificial manipulation in research and therapies. Here, we present DAMAGE (Death Manipulation Gene), an innovative system that integrates gasdermins within the type III-E CRISPR framework, enabling the specific recognition of target RNA (tgRNA) and triggering pyroptosis. This mechanism allows DAMAGE to selectively identify and eliminate virus-infected, cancerous, and senescent cells, all of which exhibit altered RNA transcriptomes. Additionally, DAMAGE exhibits considerable promise as\u00a0a platform for mRNA-LNP therapy. Our study highlights the potential of this CRISPR-based system in the controllable induction of pyroptosis, offering an innovative therapeutic strategy for treating RNA-heterogeneous diseases.","83":"Glioma, the most prevalent primary brain tumor, primarily arises from glial cells or their progenitors. Histologically, gliomas are classified into astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas. Due to their aggressive invasive nature and resistance to chemotherapy, gliomas exhibit high recurrence rates and poor clinical outcomes. Regulated cell death (RCD) refers to a set of genetically controlled cellular processes that significantly influence tumor behavior. RCD plays a dual role in cancer: under normal physiological conditions, it eliminates malignant cells to prevent tumorigenesis, while in pathological conditions, tumor cells evade RCD to gain survival advantages. Furthermore, distinct RCD pathways can modulate the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby affecting therapeutic outcomes. Targeting RCD mechanisms presents a promising strategy to overcome therapeutic resistance and advance innovative glioma immunotherapies. This review explores the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy in glioma, emphasizing their critical roles in tumor progression. It also examines therapeutic strategies targeting RCD, including recent advancements in glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitors, oncolytic virotherapy, and other emerging agents. Furthermore, the review discusses the potential of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems and multi-omics approaches to optimize personalized combination therapies, aiming to enhance multimodal, synergistic interventions for more effective glioma management.","84":"Bioorthogonal chemistry has become a robust toolbox with growing applications in biology and medicine. To meet diverse needs in research, new types of on-demand bioorthogonal reactions capable of responding to biological triggers or exogenous stimuli are highly valuable, to achieve spatial and temporal control over reactions in living systems. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species have been implicated in aging and multiple diseases, serving as remarkable endogenous triggers for prodrugs, probes and materials, however ROS-activated bioorthogonal ligation remains as a challenge. Here we report a reactive oxygen species activated tetrazine ligation enabled by boronate-caged dihydrotetrazines. Bioorthogonal handle tetrazines can be in situ generated from boronate-caged dihydrotetrazines upon the elevated level of hydrogen peroxide, resulting in spatiotemporal control of subsequent reactions with dienophiles. Using this strategy, a reactive oxygen species triggered construction of proteolysis targeting chimera for targeted degradation of the protein of interest bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is successfully established by tagging boronate-caged dihydrotetrazines with a cereblon E3 ligase recruiter. Furthermore, we demonstrate a reactive oxygen species triggered tetrazine ligation enabled tumor-selective drug delivery in both living cells and mice. The present reactive oxygen species responsive delivery of cytotoxin doxorubicin via a click-to-release reaction between boronate-caged dihydrotetrazines and trans-cyclooctene modified doxorubicin shows excellent chemotherapeutic efficacy and safety in suppressing the growth of some tumors, superior to both direct administration of doxorubicin and reactive oxygen species sensitive prodrug of boronate-caged doxorubicin. We expect this reactive oxygen species responsive bioorthogonal reaction will offer compelling opportunities for precision therapy and provide approaches for studying pathogenesis.","85":"The pathological hallmark of schistosomiasis is egg-induced granulomatous inflammation and the subsequent fibrosis in the liver; and mesenchymal stem cells have been explored for the treatment of schistosomiasis fibrosis. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We demonstrated here that IFN-\u03b3\/ LPS-primed MSCs alleviate schistosomiasis fibrosis through promoting conversion of Ly6C<sup>hi<\/sup>CX3CR1<sup>lo<\/sup> to pro-resolving Ly6C<sup>lo<\/sup>CX3CR1<sup>hi<\/sup>. Importantly, primed MSCs promoted macrophage efferocytosis in the infected mice, and in vitro experiments confirmed the direct role of primed MSC on enhancement of macrophage efferocytosis, as well as its conversion to pro-resolving type. Mechanistically, primed MSC promoted \u03b22 integrins(Itgb2) expression within macrophages; and Itgb2 blockade not only inhibited GTPase Rac1 activity, a key regulator of actin filament organization during efferocytosis, but also abolished the enhancement of primed MSCs on macrophage efferocytosis, suggesting that primed MSCs enhance efferocytosis via Itgb2-Rac1 axis. Moreover, either Itgb2 blockade or Rac1 inhibition within macrophages reversed the regulation of primed MSCs on macrophage subset switching, suggesting that primed MSCs promote macrophage subset conversion dependent on efferocytosis pathway. Taken together, this study demonstrates that primed MSCs attenuate schistosomiasis liver fibrosis by enhancing macrophage subset switch and efferocytosis via Itgb2-Rac1 axis, which offers novel insights into the therapeutic targets of MSC-based anti-fibrotic therapy.","86":"Obesity and type-2 diabetes, two interconnected and increasingly prevalent metabolic disorders, are associated with poor bone quality, higher fracture risk, and impaired fracture repair. The causes are not yet resolved but appear to relate to the impaired glucose homeostasis, altered bone material properties and remodeling, and compromised skeletal vascularization. Each of these features is impacted by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling, which led us to hypothesize that HIF pathway modulation might be an effective strategy to concomitantly improve energy metabolism and bone health in conditions of metabolic stress. Here, we evaluated whether pharmacological HIF activation using the HIF-prolyl-hydroxylase-domain enzyme (PHD) inhibitor FG-4592 (Roxadustat) could protect mice against the adverse skeletal and metabolic consequences of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. We found that systemic FG-4592 treatment effectively prevented HFD-triggered body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and peripheral fat accumulation, associated with globally increased energy expenditure. Concomitantly, FG-4592 administration prevented the skeletal vascular damage, marrow fat accumulation, and bone formation deficits that were caused by HFD. Moreover, the HIF-activating drug also improved glucose metabolism and bone regeneration in a model of compromised fracture repair associated with overnutrition. Specifically, short-term FG-4592 treatment during fracture recovery reduced the body weight and fat mass of obese mice, improved glucose tolerance, and enhanced the fracture bridging capacity, along with promoting callus vascularization. These findings demonstrate that systemic hypoxia signaling stimulation using PHD inhibitors alleviates both the metabolic and skeletal consequences of diet-induced obesity in mice, highlighting its potential as a dual-action therapeutic strategy for enhancing glucose homeostasis and bone health\/regeneration in disorders of obesity and metabolic dysfunction.","87":"Our perspective addresses one of the most pressing and timely debates in contemporary neurology and health policy: whether the recent approval of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies for Alzheimer's disease should extend to all individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; a large population of tens of millions of individuals worldwide mainly represented in Countries with aged population) who test positive for amyloid biomarkers, despite wide variability in prognosis and therapeutic response and the epidemiological demonstration that only about half of them manifest symptoms of dementia. The manuscript highlights three central themes. First, while epidemiological and meta-analytic data confirm that MCI significantly increases the risk of dementia, more than half of affected individuals-many of whom are biomarker-positive for amyloid\/tau-do not progress to dementia even over long- term follow-up. Second, recently approved anti-amyloid therapies, although representing a landmark in disease-modifying treatments, carry high costs, non-negligible risks (particularly amyloid-related imaging abnormalities), and uncertain long-term real-world benefits. Third, indiscriminate prescription of these agents risks exposing large numbers of subjects to unnecessary harm while placing unsustainable burdens on healthcare systems. We argue that the field should urgently move to identify and validate accurate and sustainable instruments for risk-stratified treatment pathways, integrating genetic, clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and fluid biomarker data including risk and resilience factors to refine prognostication. In addition, we call on the scientific community, journals, and policymakers to foster dialog that bridges neurology, geriatrics, bioethics, health economics, and patient advocacy, so that clinical innovation is matched by ethical responsibility and equitable implementation.","88":"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a significant global health concern affecting women, yet effective and innovative therapeutic targets remain limited. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic risk loci, their underlying mechanisms and translational potential remain poorly understood. Therefore, we integrated PPD GWAS data with protein quantitative trait loci from two independent datasets to identify risk genes through proteome-wide association studies (PWAS). Validation was performed using colocalization analysis and Mendelian randomization (MR). To assess the safety of genes as drug targets, phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR) was conducted using the UK Biobank disease data. Finally, we performed gene methylation analysis in PPD patients, alongside validation of expression in key brain regions including anterior cingulate gyrus (AnCg), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens, as well as in peripheral blood (whole blood and leukocytes), across depressive patients and chronic mild stress mice. Co-expression enrichment was used to identify biological pathways associated with risk genes. PWAS and colocalization analysis identified MKRN1 and CCDC92 as overlapping risk genes, with MKRN1 validated in MR. Phe-MR showed non-significant association between MKRN1 dysregulation and disease beyond depression and mood disorders, suggesting minimal off-target effects. Methylation analysis in PPD patients' blood revealed significant hypomethylation of MKRN1, consistent with expression analysis that confirmed its upregulation in AnCg and as a biomarker in blood. Enrichment analysis indicated MKRN1 involvement in immune-inflammatory pathways. Our study identified MKRN1 as a therapeutic target for PPD, integrating multi-omics evidence from genomics, proteomics, and druggable proteome profiling, and offering a promising path for targeted treatments.","89":"The microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel remains the standard of care for various solid malignancies but frequently leads to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN is a leading cause for premature treatment termination and a significantly reduced quality of life in long-term cancer survivors. The molecular mechanisms of neuro-axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation, and pain in patients treated with paclitaxel remain incompletely understood, and there are currently no predictive biomarkers or preventive treatments. We used human iPSC-derived sensory neurons exposed to paclitaxel to comprehensively model the pathophysiology of CIPN. Neurotoxicity was assessed over time using viability assays and sequential RNA sequencing, as well as deep proteome and lipidomic analyses. We observed a time and dose-dependent decline of cell viability at clinically relevant paclitaxel doses. Sequential RNA sequencing defined JUN as an early immediate gene, followed by the overexpression of genes of the neuronal stress response (e.g., ARID5A, WEE1, DUSP16, GADD45A), neuronal injury and apoptotic pathways (e.g., ATF3, HRK, BBC3 [PUMA], BCL2L11 [BIM], CASP3), neuroinflammation and nociception (CALCB, MMP10, IL31RA, CYSLTR2, C3AR1, TNFRSF12A) and neuronal transduction (e.g., CAMK2A, STOML3, PIRT), while key enzymes of lipid biosynthesis were markedly downregulated (e.g., LSS, HMGCS1, HMGCR, DHCR24). Deep proteome analyses following 48\u2009h of exposure to 100\u2009nM paclitaxel revealed a strong correlation of differentially expressed RNA with proteins, and a marked degradation of essential axonal transport proteins such as kinesins, stathmins, and scaffold proteins. Consistent with the downregulation of rate-limiting enzymes of lipid biosynthesis, lipidome analysis confirmed deregulation of neuronal lipid homeostasis. In summary, paclitaxel induces transcriptomic and proteomic signatures of the neuronal stress response, neuroinflammation, nociception, and disturbed metabolism. These may explain, in part, the clinical phenotype of sensory loss, hypersensitivity, and neuropathic pain frequently observed in patients suffering from CIPN, but constitute pharmacologically addressable targets.","90":"No abstract available","91":"To investigate the minimal detectable change (MDC) and minimal important change (MIC) of the Simple Test for Evaluating Hand Function (STEF) in patients with subacute stroke. Prospective longitudinal study at a single rehabilitation hospital. Fifty-three patients with subacute stroke. Patients received standard stroke rehabilitation, including physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Upper extremity function was assessed using the STEF at admission, the next day, and 4\u2009weeks later. The primary outcome was the STEF score. Additional measures were the Global Rating of Change Scale (GRCS), the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) self-care domain, and the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Test - retest reliability and MDC were calculated. MIC was estimated using an anchor-based receiver operating characteristic analysis and an adjusted logistic regression approach. The STEF showed excellent reliability, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.98 and a MDC<sub>95<\/sub> of 12.7 points. Anchor-based MIC values were 14.5 points for participants' GRCS, 9.0 points for therapists' GRCS, 11.5 points for the FIM self-care domain, and 16.0 points for the mRS. Adjusted predictive values were 7.9, 8.6, 9.5, and 16.6 points, respectively. A change greater than 12 points on the STEF likely exceeds measurement error. These thresholds support interpretation of patient changes and guide clinical decision-making in subacute stroke rehabilitation.","92":"To investigate the effects of core stabilization training (CST), combined with standard rehabilitation, on pain, upper extremity function, shoulder muscle strength, and core stability in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS). Forty-four patients with SIS were randomly assigned to either the core stabilization group (CST\u2009+\u2009standard rehabilitation) or the control group (standard rehabilitation) and received the interventions for 12\u2009weeks. Primary outcomes were pain and upper extremity function, and secondary outcomes were shoulder muscle strength and core stability parameters. Assessments were performed at baseline and at weeks 3, 6, and 12. A significant main effect of time was observed for pain, upper extremity function, shoulder strength, and core stability (<i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001). Significant group\u2009\u00d7\u2009time interactions in favor of the core stabilization group were found for rest pain (<i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.006), activity pain (<i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.035), upper extremity function (<i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.001), and core stability (<i>p<\/i>\u2009<\u20090.01). Other outcomes showed no significant differences between groups (<i>p<\/i>\u2009>\u20090.05). CST combined with standard rehabilitation is effective in reducing pain, improving upper extremity function and core stability in patients with SIS. While it does not provide additional benefits for shoulder muscle strength over standard rehabilitation. NCT05966298.","93":"Cancer mortality is associated with modifiable health behaviors such as physical activity, alcohol intake, and diet; however, it is estimated that only 5-25% of cancer survivors adhere to health behavior recommendations after diagnosis. With the overburdened infrastructure of healthcare in the United States and the high out-of-pocket expenditures for cancer patients, it is challenging for cancer survivors to access personalized lifestyle medicine in many settings. In this Perspective, an interdisciplinary team of cancer rehabilitation and lifestyle medicine clinicians outline the potential for synergy between the two fields to illustrate the possibilities for improvement in cancer care when the two disciplines are integrated. We outline key concepts and present a case example from Re-invent, Integrate, Strengthen, Expand (RISE), an occupational therapy-based cancer survivorship clinic employing the tenets of lifestyle medicine in a major urban medical center in the United States. Cancer rehabilitation clinicians are uniquely situated to collaborate with lifestyle medicine clinicians in the assessment of lifestyle-related issues and interventions designed to mitigate these issues. The RISE cancer survivorship clinic provides a practical, real-life example of this collaboration in action. Cancer care throughout the continuum may benefit from an increase in synergistic activities between these two professional domains.","94":"Covalent inhibitors and chemical probes targeting ligandable cysteine residues have emerged as powerful tools for drug discovery and proteomics. In this study, we introduce vinyl phosphonamidates (VPAs) as a novel class of latent cysteine electrophiles and assess their reactivity, selectivity, and potential for developing covalent inhibitors. Compared to well-established chloroacetamide and acrylamide electrophiles, VPAs exhibit a significantly lower intrinsic reactivity toward the model thiol glutathione. Moreover, VPA-derived covalent fragments displayed only very limited nonspecific reactivity in human cell lysate. Encouraged by these results, we developed VPA-functionalized derivatives of the FDA-approved covalent inhibitors Afatinib and Ibrutinib and evaluated their ability to engage the target protein by gel-based and mass spectrometry-based activity-based protein profiling (ABPP). Compared to commonly employed Michael acceptor-based electrophilic groups, VPA-functionalized drug ligands displayed significantly less off-targets while maintaining inhibitor efficiency. Furthermore, we leveraged the modular nature and accessibility of VPAs to develop a bifunctional proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) for targeted protein degradation. The demonstrated selectivity and modularity, as exemplified by the incorporation of various ligands on the phosphorus <i>O<\/i>-substituent, of the vinyl phosphonamidate group as a cysteine-directed electrophile highlight its ability to expand the chemical space in the development of covalent inhibitors with a favorable proteome-wide reactivity profile.","95":"Although heat can enhance the immunogenicity of tumors, inhomogeneous temperature distribution in deep-seated regions often leads to insufficient thermal exposure, resulting in limited antigen release and low immunogenicity. Herein, we designed microwave-sensitizing nanomotors that activate propulsion to break through biological barriers and the deep-seated delivery of heat and immune adjuvants to activate the immune response. Specifically, this nanomotor features a core of dendritic silica (DS) asymmetrically modified with bovine serum albumin-stabilized manganese dioxide nanoparticles (MnO<sub>2<\/sub>@BSA) to form the DMB structure. Subsequently, the immune adjuvant R837 and tetradecanol were loaded to obtain the final microwave-sensitizing nanomotors, DMBR. Oxygen (O<sub>2<\/sub>) bubbles generated from the catalytic decomposition of H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> by the heterostructured MnO<sub>2<\/sub>@BSA propel the nanomotors to actively break through these biological barriers autonomously toward deep-seated tumor cells. Furthermore, microwave irradiation accelerates the production of O<sub>2<\/sub> bubbles, enhancing the nanomotor's movement efficiency. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated a 3-fold improvement of DMB. Moreover, the DMBR nanomotors promote the enhancement of heat dissemination, R837 delivery efficiency, and localized release of O<sub>2<\/sub> into deep tumor areas. Consequently, a robust immune response is triggered, as evidenced by an increased level of T cell infiltration, leading to significant suppression of both primary and distant tumors. This work presents a sequential barrier-overcoming nanomotor strategy for effective microwave thermal immunotherapy.","96":"Low-level light therapy (LLLT) in combination with intense pulsed light (IPL) has been shown to improve clinical signs and symptoms of dry eye disease (DED), as well as tear inflammatory protein levels. However, the therapeutic mechanism of LLLT as a stand-alone treatment remains unclear. This single-arm pilot study aimed to determine the impact of LLLT alone on tear protein levels in patients with DED. Study participants received a 15-minute LLLT session once a week for three weeks using the Eye-light\u00ae EPI-C Plus device. Clinical measures of DED were assessed, including first and average non-invasive keratograph tear break-up time (NIKBUT), tear meniscus height (TMH), tear film lipid layer thickness (TFLLT), and Schirmer's test. Tear samples were collected with Schirmer's strips at baseline and after the final treatment. Tear fluid was extracted by eluting the strips in PBS, and the concentrations of ten inflammatory proteins were quantified using a Luminex bead-based multiplex assay. Thirty participants (mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 31.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.5\u00a0years; 16 females) with mild to moderate DED completed the study. Compared to baseline, there was a statistically significant fold change in clinical outcome measures after the last LLLT treatment including first and average NIKBUT (mean FC (SD): 1.6 (0.9), 1.4 (0.7)), TMH (1.2 (0.3)), TFLLT (1.3 (0.4)) and Schirmer's test (0.9 (0.5)), (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There was a significant reduction in MMP-9 levels post-LLLT treatment (mean Log2FC (SD): -0.7 (1.5), p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). No significant differences were observed in the remaining analytes, and no correlations were observed between the Log2FC of MMP-9 and clinical measures (all p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Findings from this single-arm pilot study suggest that LLLT is associated with improved tear film stability and reduced MMP9 levels in patients with mild to moderate DED.","97":"Improving patients' quality of life during and after their illness has become a major objective in the field of oncology. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of stress management sessions on improving quality of life upon discharge in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. Patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery were randomized between a group that received perioperative stress management sessions as part of an Enhanced Rehabilitation After Surgery (ERAS) program and a group that did not. Outcomes were assessed using questionnaires before, during, and at discharge from hospitalization. Well-being, fatigue score, and quality of life were assessed using the Manifestations of Psychological Well-Being Scale (EMMBEP), the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), and the FACT-C scale (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal), respectively. Pain and sleep were assessed using a Visual Analog Scale. The effectiveness of stress management sessions was evaluated at discharge, and patient satisfaction was assessed at one month. Length of hospital stay and complications were compared between the two groups. Of a total of 154 patients who were randomized in the study, four patients were excluded because they did not undergo surgery, leaving 74 in the control group and 76 in the experimental group. The results showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographics. Stress management sessions did not improve patients' quality of life at discharge. Preoperative well-being was inversely correlated with the MFI fatigue score (P<0.001). Length of hospital stay and postoperative complications were not influenced by stress management sessions. Perioperative stress management sessions for colorectal cancer did not demonstrate a positive impact on quality of life at hospital discharge, and neither length of hospital stay nor postoperative complication rates were influenced by stress management sessions.","98":"Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein overexpressed in many epithelial cancers and functions as a critical driver of tumor growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. While Trop2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) such as sacituzumab govitecan have demonstrated clinical success, limitations including off-target toxicity and drug resistance underscore the need for alternative modalities. This review explores recent advances in the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting Trop2, with a focus on structure-based strategies. We summarize the oncogenic signaling mechanisms of Trop2, including regulated intramembrane proteolysis and \u03b2-catenin stabilization, and identify key structural domains such as the TY-loop, ND-CD ridge, and intracellular phosphorylation region (Ser303, Lys307, Glu310) as candidate binding pockets. Bruceine D is presented as a case study of a natural Trop2-ICD modulator, supported by docking analyses and structure activity insights. In addition, we examine fragment-based drug discovery, covalent\/allosteric inhibition, and AI-guided screening strategies, integrating computational and experimental workflows including CETSA, luciferase assays, and ADMET filtering. Together, these approaches provide a comprehensive framework for the rational design and optimization of next-generation Trop2-targeted small molecule therapeutics.","99":"Recurrence after Whipple for ampullary carcinoma remains incompletely defined; this retrospective cohort aimed to delineate patterns and predictors of failure to guide adjuvant strategies. Consecutive patients undergoing standard Whipple for histologically proven ampullary adenocarcinoma (January 2018-December 2024) were analyzed (n=189); recurrence patterns were classified, survival estimated by Kaplan-Meier, and predictors assessed by multivariable logistic regression. Over a median 30.6 months, recurrence occurred in 29.6% (distant 23.3%, local 6.3%); independent predictors of distant recurrence included CA19\u20119 >79 U\/mL (aOR 2.62; P=0.027), nodal positivity (aOR 2.50; P=0.037), and delayed gastric emptying (aOR 3.17; P=0.006), while adjuvant therapy reduced risk (aOR 0.37; P=0.018). Perineural invasion predicted local recurrence on univariate analysis (OR 8.83; P<0.001); 3\u2011 and 5\u2011year overall survival were 69% and 46.1%, respectively, and adjuvant therapy in node\u2011positive patients reduced distant recurrence from 65.0% to 15.4% (OR 0.098; P<0.001). Recurrence is predominantly systemic and driven by nodal status and CA19\u20119, adjuvant chemotherapy mitigates distant failure-particularly in N1-and the identification of delayed gastric emptying as an independent predictor underscores the oncologic importance of perioperative optimization; histologic subtype was not independently prognostic."},"url":{"0":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668202\/","1":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668201\/","2":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668197\/","3":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668195\/","4":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668193\/","5":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668176\/","6":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668168\/","7":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668166\/","8":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668164\/","9":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668148\/","10":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668125\/","11":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668117\/","12":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668102\/","13":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668089\/","14":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668085\/","15":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668076\/","16":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668074\/","17":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668073\/","18":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668072\/","19":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668046\/","20":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668042\/","21":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668040\/","22":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668037\/","23":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668029\/","24":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668002\/","25":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667983\/","26":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667974\/","27":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667944\/","28":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667939\/","29":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667931\/","30":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667930\/","31":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667929\/","32":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667927\/","33":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667916\/","34":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667911\/","35":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667904\/","36":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667900\/","37":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667897\/","38":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667893\/","39":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667886\/","40":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667884\/","41":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667882\/","42":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667874\/","43":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667851\/","44":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667850\/","45":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667845\/","46":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667836\/","47":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667835\/","48":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667798\/","49":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667793\/","50":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667790\/","51":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667777\/","52":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667776\/","53":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667767\/","54":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667759\/","55":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667750\/","56":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667744\/","57":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667737\/","58":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667704\/","59":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667701\/","60":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667695\/","61":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667683\/","62":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667674\/","63":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667668\/","64":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667662\/","65":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667661\/","66":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667648\/","67":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667647\/","68":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667622\/","69":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667603\/","70":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667598\/","71":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667590\/","72":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667539\/","73":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667527\/","74":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667511\/","75":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667502\/","76":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667490\/","77":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667482\/","78":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667477\/","79":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667465\/","80":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667463\/","81":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667461\/","82":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667457\/","83":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667445\/","84":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667439\/","85":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667438\/","86":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667436\/","87":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667430\/","88":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667429\/","89":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667428\/","90":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667421\/","91":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667392\/","92":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667391\/","93":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667388\/","94":"h
