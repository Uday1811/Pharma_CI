The manuscript highlights three central themes. First, while epidemiological and meta-analytic data confirm that MCI significantly increases the risk of dementia, more than half of affected individuals-many of whom are biomarker-positive for amyloid\/tau-do not progress to dementia even over long- term follow-up. Second, recently approved anti-amyloid therapies, although representing a landmark in disease-modifying treatments, carry high costs, non-negligible risks (particularly amyloid-related imaging abnormalities), and uncertain long-term real-world benefits. Third, indiscriminate prescription of these agents risks exposing large numbers of subjects to unnecessary harm while placing unsustainable burdens on healthcare systems. We argue that the field should urgently move to identify and validate accurate and sustainable instruments for risk-stratified treatment pathways, integrating genetic, clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and fluid biomarker data including risk and resilience factors to refine prognostication. In addition, we call on the scientific community, journals, and policymakers to foster dialog that bridges neurology, geriatrics, bioethics, health economics, and patient advocacy, so that clinical innovation is matched by ethical responsibility and equitable implementation.","1":"The growing demand for amyloid and tau PET imaging, driven by new dementia therapies and biomarker-based diagnosis, has increased the need for accessible PET brain imaging in outpatient neurology settings. This article describes the implementation of one of the first dedicated brain-only PET systems within a high-volume neurology clinic. It outlines workflow, patient experience, and operational considerations from the technologist's perspective. The dedicated system enables rapid imaging, timely interpretation, and streamlined incorporation into dementia care pathways. This experience demonstrates how brain-only PET can expand access to neuroimaging while supporting efficient technologist workflow and enhancing patient care.","2":"Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasingly diagnosed using molecular imaging biomarkers. PET imaging provides the opportunity to visualize amyloid and tau aggregates and in\u00a0vivo neurodegenerative changes. These techniques provide exciting new avenues toward diagnosis, disease staging, and therapeutic monitoring of AD. <b>Methods:<\/b> This review details recent advances in amyloid PET, tau PET, and <sup>18<\/sup>F-FDG PET as they relate to the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of AD. The increasing roles of PET in the biologically based diagnosis of AD and antiamyloid immunotherapy response monitoring are addressed. <b>Results:<\/b> Amyloid PET enables improved detection of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques within the brain. Amyloid PET is increasingly vital for confirming AD diagnoses given the emergence of antiamyloid immunotherapies, which require biomarker-verified amyloid positivity to initiate treatment. Tau PET provides a direct measure of neurofibrillary tangle pathology and is useful for disease staging, the interpretation of atypical clinical presentations, and treatment decision-making. <sup>18<\/sup>F-FDG PET plays a vital role in distinguishing AD from other dementia subtypes. Expanded reimbursement policies for amyloid and tau PET have increased accessibility to these modalities. Finally, quantitative methods facilitate interscan reproducibility and permit therapeutic monitoring. <b>Conclusion:<\/b> Molecular neuroimaging is poised to play a central role in the biologic definition, diagnosis, staging, and management of AD. Integrating amyloid, tau, and FDG PET with clinical assessments and fluid biomarkers provides earlier and more accurate diagnoses, opening the door to personalized treatment.","3":"Temporal lobe epilepsy is a form of focal epilepsy that originates in the temporal lobes, often presenting with a variety of symptoms including altered consciousness, automatisms, and focal seizures with or without impaired awareness. Given such a diversity of manifesting symptoms, recognizing temporal lobe epilepsy in the emergency department (ED) can be challenging. Early identification is crucial for appropriate management, including timely initiation of antiepileptic therapy and differentiation from other neurological emergencies. A 50-year-old male with no prior history of seizures or neurological conditions presented to the ED after experiencing unusual sensations that had begun three days earlier. The patient described an intermittent sensation of warmth rising from his pelvis to his head, accompanied by an experiential d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu-like feeling he described as \"dream reenactment.\" His episodes had become progressively more frequent, occurring approximately once every 90 minutes within the first 24 hours, with two instances of brief loss of consciousness. Diagnostic workup, including neurology consultation and an electroencephalogram in the ED, revealed a 19-second, non-motor focal seizure originating from the left anterior temporal region, consistent with temporal lobe epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no acute structural abnormalities. The patient was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy, started on lacosamide, and discharged from the ED. This case underscores the importance of recognizing temporal lobe epilepsy in the ED, particularly in patients with recurrent episodes of altered consciousness or unusual sensory experiences. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to preventing further seizures and improving quality of life.","4":"Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) manifests with neurological symptoms not attributable to structural abnormalities of the nervous system and is the second most common reason for referral to neurologists. Despite being treatable, FND is frequently underdiagnosed and linked to significant disability and emotional distress. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes of Moroccan healthcare professionals toward FND and explore misconceptions surrounding this condition. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 127 physicians across Morocco using an anonymous, online questionnaire disseminated via Google Forms. A snowball sampling approach was used, with the link distributed through social media and major unofficial specialty clusters on WhatsApp. The survey explored participants' awareness, beliefs, and clinical practices regarding FND. Neurologists and neurology residents constituted 58% of respondents, followed by medical interns, general practitioners, and psychiatry residents. Overall, 22% reported no prior knowledge of FND, and 61% had never received formal training. Misconceptions were widespread: 18% associated FND with hysteria, 29% viewed it as purely psychological, and 10% were unaware of its pathophysiology. Only 4% recognized positive diagnostic signs, while 67% perceived FND solely as a diagnosis of exclusion. Additionally, 22% believed patients might exaggerate symptoms, 16% considered paraclinical examinations unnecessary, 44% thought psychiatric history was essential for diagnosis, and 50% underestimated the harms of underdiagnosis. These findings highlight an urgent need for targeted educational interventions to correct misconceptions, promote accurate diagnosis, and improve patient care. Addressing these gaps could mitigate FND's social and economic burden in Morocco.","5":"Neurological disorders represent a devastating global health crisis, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major obstacle for their treatment. Conventional strategies for BBB opening, including direct intracranial injection, osmotic disruption, receptor-mediated transcytosis, and nanoparticle carriers, often suffers from surgical invasiveness, systemic toxicity, poor biodistribution, and off-target effects. Ultrasound-mediated drug delivery has emerged as a revolutionary non-invasive technology for transient and targeted BBB opening, enabling enhanced penetration of therapeutic agents into the central nervous system. This review comprehensively summarizes the mechanisms underlying ultrasound-based delivery with focus on current delivery platforms including microbubble (MB)-assisted, nanoparticle-based, and MB-nanoparticle composite strategies. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in the application of focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with MBs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and glioma. Finally, we discuss emerging technologies such as sonodynamic therapy and ultrasound-controlled magnetic nanorobots, while also addressing current challenges in this field. This review underscores the transformative potential of ultrasound-mediated drug delivery as a versatile platform for precision neurology. It also prospects future directions for advancing multidisciplinary research and clinical translation.","6":"The blood biomarker p-tau217 has demonstrated high accuracy in predicting underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, its feasibility and impact on clinician confidence and diagnosis in real-world clinical settings remain underexplored. We aimed to evaluate the effect of implementing blood p-tau217 testing on both diagnosis and diagnostic confidence in patients with cognitive symptoms across two different clinical settings: general neurology consultations referred from primary care and a specialized memory unit. We included 200 consecutive new patients (38.5% with subjective cognitive complaints, 47.5% mild cognitive impairment, and 14% with dementia) evaluated for cognitive symptoms in two distinct clinical settings: general neurology and a memory unit. Attending neurologists were asked to record a pre-biomarker clinical diagnosis and their diagnostic confidence on a scale from 0 to 10. They repeated this assessment after receiving the p-tau217 results. Across the whole sample, 51\/200 patients (25.5%) had a change in their diagnostic category after receiving p-tau217 levels. Furthermore, diagnostic confidence significantly improved from 6.90\u2009\u00b1\u20091.74 at the first visit to 8.49\u2009\u00b1\u20091.68 after the test. Changes in diagnosis and confidence were observed in both general neurology and memory unit settings, and across all clinical stages (subjective cognitive complaints, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia). Compared with the final diagnosis, the pre-biomarker diagnosis was maintained in 71\/200 cases (75.5%) (Kappa\u2009=\u20090.576), while the post-biomarker diagnosis was maintained in 189\/200 cases (94.5%) (Kappa\u2009=\u20090.906). Implementing p-tau217 in real-world clinical practice has a strong clinical impact, substantially improving diagnostic accuracy and confidence in both general neurology and memory units across all stages of cognitive decline.","7":"The growing recognition of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction across a broad spectrum of neurological and systemic diseases calls for structured, multidisciplinary care. This position statement by the European Federation of Autonomic Societies aims to provide guidance on establishing an autonomic unit within a neurology department. A Task Force appointed by the European Federation of Autonomic Societies board in October 2022 proposed staffing and equipment requirements for autonomic units, based on a literature review, survey data from ANS laboratories, and existing diagnostic guidelines. These propositions were integrated into the initial 25 questions and refined using a modified Delphi method to achieve expert consensus. Consensus was predefined as \u2265\u200980% agreement. Statements that did not reach consensus were revised and reassessed in subsequent rounds. After three rounds of Delphi surveys, expert consensus was achieved on the minimal and optimal requirements for autonomic unit personnel, technical equipment, and the availability of multidisciplinary care. This European Federation of Autonomic Societies position statement presents practical, expert-based recommendations to promote the development of autonomic units across various healthcare systems. By establishing minimum and optimal standards for staffing, equipment, and interdisciplinary collaboration, the document offers a clear framework for standardizing clinical care and supporting collaborative research. This statement serves as a foundational resource for clinicians, administrators, and policymakers committed to strengthening the ANS care infrastructure.","8":"As a core medication for the prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm, especially after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, real-time monitoring of nimodipine (NMD) concentration helps evaluate the adequacy of drug therapy and holds great significance for ensuring patient life and health. Herein, based on dual functional monomers, a molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor (MIECS) for the detection of NMD with nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) and Fe-MOFs was developed. Fe-MOFs provided a large specific surface area, offering more space for generating imprinting sites, while N-CNTs enhanced the conductivity of the electrode. 2-Amino-5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (AMT) and <i>o<\/i>-phenylenediamine (<i>o<\/i>-PD) served as dual functional monomers and NMD as the template molecule. A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) membrane was prepared on the electrode surface by electropolymerization. Compared to single functional monomers, the dual functional monomers exhibited better selectivity and specificity in NMD recognition. Under optimal experimental conditions, the response of the MIECS to NMD showed a linear relationship ranging from 10<sup>-14<\/sup> M to 10<sup>-8<\/sup> M, with a detection limit of 2.97 \u00d7 10<sup>-15<\/sup> M. Satisfactory recovery rates were obtained in the detection of human serum and tablets. This multi-parametric enhancement establishes a new paradigm for therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical neurology and pharmaceutical quality control.","9":"Uterine artery embolisation (UAE) is a recognised minimally invasive treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids, with a generally favourable safety profile. Although post-embolisation complications are well documented, vulvar necrosis is exceptionally rare. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman of Black African heritage who developed severe vulvar symptoms eight days after UAE was undertaken for symptomatic multiple fibroids. She presented with intense vulvar pain, swelling, erythema, ulceration, and right-sided gluteal skin changes, alongside numbness in the lateral right leg. Examination revealed ulceration and sloughing of the right vulva, with progression to gluteal necrosis over seven days. CT and MRI imaging demonstrated inflammatory changes and infarction of the subcutaneous fat in the right buttock, consistent with non-target embolisation. Multidisciplinary assessment concluded that the findings were due to extravasation of embolic material into the gluteal region. The patient received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, neuropathic pain management, and multidisciplinary care involving gynaecology, surgery, interventional radiology, pain management, neurology, and tissue viability teams. She underwent surgical debridement of the necrotic vulvar tissue, achieving full healing. The gluteal necrosis was managed conservatively with spontaneous resolution. At three-month follow-up, she was asymptomatic from a gynaecological perspective; at two years, she was diagnosed with right leg pain syndrome, possibly piriformis-related. Vulvar necrosis following UAE is an exceptionally rare but clinically significant complication. This case highlights the need for early recognition of post-procedural vulvar or gluteal changes and rapid multidisciplinary intervention to optimise outcomes. Increased reporting of such cases may help clarify risk factors, refine preventive strategies, and guide management.","10":"Hospitalized patients often experience poor sleep, which is associated with worse health outcomes, increased rates of delirium, and readmissions. To improve overnight sleep for clinically stable general neurology patients at a single academic center. We conducted a quasi-experimental pre-post clinical trial of two sleep-protective interventions: (1) a sleep-friendly order set that reduced overnight interruptions by discontinuing vital sign checks\/neurological examinations and retiming medications\/blood draws; and (2) a \"sleep menu\" of comfort items. The primary outcome measure was sleep duration. Secondary outcomes were awakenings and patient responses to the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Safety outcomes were rates of delirium, ICU transfers, and 30-day readmissions. We compared the groups using linear mixed-effects models to account for repeated measures (multiple nights per participant). We analyzed data from 66 pre-intervention participants (238 nights) and 61 post-intervention participants (244 nights). The interventions did not increase sleep duration (pre-intervention median 5.5\u2009h [interquartile range (IQR) 4.0,6.6], post-intervention median 5.4\u2009h [4.1, 6.7], p\u2009=\u2009.84). There was marginal improvement in nightly awakenings (pre-intervention 2 [1, 4], post-intervention 2 [1, 3], p\u2009=\u2009.04). There were no significant differences in subjective sleep measures or safety outcomes. Targeted care team interruptions all significantly decreased post-intervention, though staff intrusions remained a common patient-reported barrier to sleep. Fragmented and reduced sleep was common in our general neurology population. Although our interventions did not improve sleep outcomes-apart from a modest drop in nocturnal awakenings-there was a significant decrease in care team interruptions. Poor inpatient sleep is multifactorial, and meaningful change likely requires comprehensive interventions.","11":"To evaluate the impact of a national career exploration program, Exploring DBP, on trainee interest in pursuing exploring developmental-behavioral pediatrics (DBP) fellowship, and to describe participant demographics, knowledge gains, and perceived barriers to entering the field. Presurvey and postsurvey results were analyzed from the program's 2019 to 2023 cohorts assessing demographics, DBP knowledge, program satisfaction, and likelihood to apply for fellowship. Data were analyzed descriptively. Qualitative responses were analyzed to explore career decision factors. From 2019 to 2023, 239 participants completed the program (50.1% residents, 44.8% medical students, and 5.0% general pediatricians). The cohort had greater representation of trainees from ethnically diverse backgrounds compared with national averages (e.g., 26.6% Hispanic vs 7%-9%). Participants consistently rated mentorship and personal stories from DBP professionals as the most valuable program components. After the program, the proportion of participants who were \"likely\" or \"very likely\" to apply for a DBP fellowship rose from 46% to 79%. Key reported barriers to pursuing fellowship included inadequate compensation, training length, student loan burden, and competing interest in fields such as child psychiatry or neurology. A 2022 follow-up survey found that 41% of eligible early participants had successfully matched into a DBP fellowship program. The program effectively increased knowledge and interest in pursuing a DBP career. Structured early exposure may support recruitment into undersubscribed pediatric subspecialties.","12":"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction. The diagnosis typically relies on clinical features, serologic testing, and neurophysiological assessment but provocation tests such as the edrophonium test can provide rapid supportive information; however, data on its diagnostic performance are limited. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance and safety of the edrophonium test in MG. We conducted a retrospective case\u2013control study of patients who underwent an edrophonium test at the Department of Neurology of the Medical University of Vienna between January 1991 and January 2024. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios and performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify variables associated with a positive edrophonium test. Additionally, we assessed the safety of the edrophonium test. We included 182 patients with MG (41.2% female; mean age 55.8 years) and 324 controls (55.2% female; mean age 53.6 years). The edrophonium test had a sensitivity of 83.5% and a specificity of 87.7% in diagnosing MG. Patients with a decrement after repetitive nerve stimulation had higher odds of a positive response to the edrophonium test (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.48\u201310.33, <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.0067), while odds were lower in patients with MuSK-MG compared to patients with AChR-MG (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01\u20130.82, <i>p<\/i>\u2009=\u20090.0254). Adverse events were reported in 58 patients (11.5%), in most of whom (53 patients, 91.4%) they were mild. We provide data on the diagnostic performance and safety of the edrophonium test, supporting its use as an adjunctive diagnostic test for the diagnosis of MG.

Anti-recoverin antibodies are intracellular antibodies and a well-known marker of paraneoplastic retinopathy. However, they have rarely been associated with neurological and psychiatric diseases with or without cancer. To date, there have been only a few identified cases of anti-recoverin antibody-associated limbic AE. A 33-year-old North-African female with a family history of cancer and no relevant medical history presented to the neurology department of the Military Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia, with a 3-month history of temporal epilepsy, insomnia, and mild cognitive impairment. The episodes lasted 3-4 minutes. Scalp electroencephalogram showed bilateral epileptiform spikes and spike waves in the temporal regions. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral hippocampal and thalamic hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted imaging with hypointensities in the same regions on T1-weighted imaging and no contrast enhancement. Anti-recoverin antibodies were strongly positive (3+) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient met the criteria for definite limbic AE after exclusion of alternative etiologies. The extended cancer work-up was unremarkable. The patient received 1 g daily of intravenous methylprednisolone for 5 days, along with 1000 mg\/day of oral levetiracetam followed by 0.4 g\/kg\/day of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for 5 days. Levetiracetam was replaced by lamotrigine (100 mg\/day) orally. During the 2-year follow-up, the patient's condition improved clinically and radiologically. Anti-recoverin antibody positivity persisted (1+) to date with minimal symptoms. Our case illustrated the value of testing anti-recoverin antibodies in CSF and provides insights into management and prognosis through a longitudinal 2-year follow-up. Anti-recoverin antibody-related AE is a rare but treatable cause of adult subacute encephalopathy and epilepsy. Prompt and optimized management associating appropriate anti-epileptic drugs and immunotherapies is essential to alleviate sequelae.","14":"To assess the predictive accuracy of early neurophysiological and neuroimaging biomarkers, alone and in combination, for adverse neurodevelopmental disorders in term-born infants with neonatal encephalopathy (NE). Systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Diagnostic Test Accuracy guidelines. Eligible studies included infants born at term with NE who underwent amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) or EEG and MRI of the brain within the first month of life. Adverse outcomes, assessed at 18-36 months of age, were defined as cerebral palsy, postneonatal epilepsy, severe hearing or visual impairment, moderate-to-severe developmental delay, or death attributable to NE. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase and Web of Science from database inception to 10 June 2025; risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-Comparative (QUADAS-C) tool. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of abnormal aEEG background, EEG background, EEG seizures and MRI injury, individually and in combination, for predicting adverse outcomes, pooled using Bayesian bivariate random effects meta-analyses. 27 studies including 1843 infants were analysed. MRI injury was the individual predictor with higher DOR estimate (31.01, 95%\u2009CI 15.07 to 72.82), followed by abnormal EEG background (16.84, 95%\u2009CI 5.88 to 50.59), while abnormal aEEG background and EEG seizures performed less well (7.99, 95%\u2009CI 2.40 to 33.00; 4.46, 95%\u2009CI 1.86 to 11.42). Combining EEG background with MRI injury improved DOR (78.59, 95%\u2009CI 19.72 to 321.36) and specificity (93.8%, 95%\u2009CI 85.2% to 97.9%) compared with MRI alone. MRI is a strong individual predictor of adverse outcomes in NE. Combining it with early EEG improves prognostic accuracy and may better support clinical decision-making.

Twenty-five pediatric patients with a spike-wave index (SWI) \u226550% and a minimum of 2\u2009years of follow-up were analyzed in this retrospective cohort study. Clinical data, electroencephalogram (EEG) findings, and neuroimaging results were assessed, and their relationship with residual neurological or electrophysiological abnormalities was examined. The patients' mean age was 9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.97\u2009years, with a mean age at seizure onset of 6.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.32\u2009years. Etiologically, 60% of patients were unknown, and 40% were known. The baseline mean SWI was 67.1%, decreasing to 13.8% by the 24th month. Patients with residual findings had significantly higher SWI values at months 3, 6, and 24 (p\u2009=\u2009.04, p\u2009=\u2009.006, and p\u2009=\u2009.01, respectively). Additionally, these patients exhibited lower EEG background frequency and higher amplitude during wakefulness (p\u2009=\u2009.026 and p\u2009=\u2009.001). Abnormal neurological examination was significantly associated with the presence of residual findings (p\u2009=\u2009.02). Early and substantial reduction in SWI is associated with better prognosis. Persistent high SWI and abnormal background EEG activity may serve as predictors of long-term neurological impairment. These findings underscored the importance of early identification of high-risk patients and personalized treatment strategies in the management of DEE-SWAS.","16":"Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a rare disorder leading to multisystem involvement due to impaired DNA repair. Recent advances in targeted therapies highlight the importance of early diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate clinical, radiological, and genetic variability in patients with AT and examine genotype-phenotype associations and diagnostic timing. A retrospective study was conducted on genetically confirmed AT patients followed in four pediatric neurology centers in T\u00fcrkiye over a 12-year period. A total of 21 patients with AT were included; the median age at symptom onset was 26\u2009months, and the median age at diagnosis was 60\u2009months, with a diagnostic delay of 21\u2009months. Ocular telangiectasia was present in all patients. Ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and dysarthria were other common features. Involuntary movements and strabismus were each observed in 52.4%. Cerebellar atrophy was noted in 57.1%, and decreased immunoglobulin levels in 95.2%. No significant differences in the frequency of clinical findings were observed between early and late diagnosis groups, except that recurrent respiratory tract infections were significantly more common in the early-diagnosis group (p\u2009=\u20090.035). In this study, clinical variability and key clinical features of AT were identified. AT should be suspected and immunoglobulin levels assessed in patients with neurological symptoms and recurrent infections. Improving recognition of AT may contribute to earlier diagnosis and better outcomes.","17":"We report a 58-year-old woman with bipolar I disorder on long-term lithium and aripiprazole who developed a progressive asymmetric resting tremor and rigidity. Despite stopping both agents, the tremor persisted for more than a year. Dopamine transporter imaging showed reduced uptake in the left putamen, confirming idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) with superimposed drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP). Management included discontinuing lithium, switching aripiprazole to quetiapine to limit motor worsening, and starting carbidopa-levodopa. Motor symptoms improved, but hypomanic symptoms emerged and required psychiatric dose adjustments, while apathy remained prominent. The case illustrates diagnostic overshadowing in bipolar disorder (BD) and highlights two practical lessons. When parkinsonian signs are atypical or persist after medication changes, consider idiopathic PD rather than attributing symptoms to side effects. Care is best delivered through close collaboration between psychiatry and neurology to balance dopaminergic therapy with mood stabilization.","18":"Intradiploic encephalocele (IE) is a rare condition with very few reported cases in the literature. IE is defined as a herniation of the brain parenchyma through a dural defect into the diploic space. We present a 59-year-old man with intradiploic cerebellar encephalocele diagnosed in a background of clicks on the head when pressing over the ipsilateral occipital bone. Imaging confirmed right cerebellar brain herniation through the diploic space. Two years of follow-up imaging revealed herniation size progression with no neurology. The patient chose a watch-and-see approach given the potential morbidity of the surgical treatment. Asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic IE does not require surgical treatment. However, both clinicians and patients need to be aware of potential radiological progression during the follow-up period.","19":"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical period for the prevention of dementia, and multidomain interventions can effectively delay and improve patients' cognitive decline. However, it remains a great challenge concerning the initiation and maintenance of interventions for MCI patients currently. To explore influencing factors of the initiation and maintenance of multidomain interventions in patients with MCI. This study was conducted with the recruitment of patients with MCI admitting to the Department of Neurology, Cognitive Center, and Cognitive Training Nursing Clinic of a Grade A Tertiary Hospital in Nanjing, as well as those identified through community screening, between September 2024 and February 2025 via purposive sampling. Data were collected via face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Meanwhile, data analysis for theme extraction in the study was performed through a deductive-inductive approach under the guidance of the multi-theory model (MTM). This study extracted two themes and eleven subthemes: Behavior initiation (perceived disease threat triggering service seeking and participation; disease cognitive biases and cognitive anosognosia hindering intervention initiation; perceived benefits of interventions; cognitive expectations of rehabilitation outcomes; barriers to accessing and utilizing intervention resources; economic cost-benefit tradeoffs). Behavior maintenance (positive experiences during interventions; self-regulation during interventions; diverse external support; high time preference during interventions; impact of frailty and comorbidities). Multidomain interventions for patients with MCI are affected by complex and multiple factors. These factors should be considered in the clinical setting, with the formulation of targeted intervention strategies to improve patients' participation in and adherence to multidomain interventions. Furthermore, it may contribute to the transformation of the interventions from effective to practical implementation and delay the progression of the disease.","20":"No abstract available","21":"As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly becomes an integral tool in clinical neurology, future clinicians will need to master its application in patient care. While previous studies focused primarily on medical students' perspectives, our survey, addressed to Italian neurology residents, aims to assess their familiarity with AI tools and identify educational needs of learners close to clinical practice and care delivery. A cross-sectional, web-based survey designed by the University of Milan was distributed nationwide to neurology residents from May 22 through July 30, 2025. The questionnaire included items on demographics, self-assessed AI knowledge, exposure to AI training, clinical applications, perceived challenges, and attitudes toward the impact of AI on neurology practice. Descriptive statistics and association analyses were performed. A total of 173 residents (12.7%) completed the survey, with 37% affiliated with research hospitals. Although AI is frequently used in practice, with 40.7% using AI tools at least on a weekly basis, only 30.7% rated their knowledge as \"good\" or higher. Paradoxically, most residents (79.2%) reported no curriculum-integrated AI education, which was instead significantly associated with geographical background (\u03a7<sup>2<\/sup> = 45.36, <i>p<\/i> < 0.001), while nearly all respondents expressed interest in further AI training (93.1%). The most familiar application was generative AI for clinical decision support (64.2%), and neuroimaging was rated as the first AI integration area (mean priority 2.99). Main barriers to AI application included concerns about reliability (71.1%) and data privacy (43.9%). Regarding career perspectives, 41.6% of residents believed that AI will create new job opportunities, whereas most (89%) agreed that the AI revolution will not replace human professionals. Despite the limited number of participants, our survey provides a representative snapshot of AI knowledge, use, and attitudes among neurology residents in Italy, a critical country in the digital health care transformation, contributing important evidence for international shared recommendations on AI educational needs to support future clinical practice. Although AI tools are widely used, most residents had only basic knowledge and limited formal training, prompting calls for more structured, learner-centered educational modules to be integrated into neurology curricula.","22":"Longevity research has traditionally emphasized peripheral organ systems, metabolic optimization, and molecular aging pathways, while comparatively neglecting the central nervous system as the primary determinant of healthspan. This editorial advances the thesis that the brain functions as the rate-limiting organ of longevity. Drawing on systems neuroscience, clinical neurology, and evidence from neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease, it is argued that progressive disruption of neural networks governs functional decline across multiple physiological systems, regardless of peripheral biological age. Cognitive resilience, autonomic regulation, sleep integrity, affective stability, and behavioral capacity are centrally mediated processes that determine an individual's ability to maintain homeostasis over time. When brain function deteriorates, lifespan may persist, but meaningful healthspan collapses. A Brain-First Longevity Framework (BFLF) is proposed that prioritizes preservation and restoration of neural network function as foundational to extending durable, functional longevity. BFLF has direct implications for clinical practice, therapeutic development, and the future architecture of longevity medicine.","23":"Chorea is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by involuntary, spontaneous, irregular, purposeless movements that flow unpredictably from one body part to another.\u00a0An overlap between movement disorders and neuroendocrine abnormalities is widely recognized; however, chorea is a rare complication of hyperthyroidism.\u00a0In this case report, we present a case of unilateral upper limb chorea as a manifestation of hyperthyroidism. We describe a clinical case of a 21-year-old male who presented repeatedly to the emergency department (ED) with acute-onset, involuntary proximal movements of the left upper limb (LUL), arrhythmic in nature, without involvement of the face, trunk, or lower limbs (LLs). Neurological examination\u00a0and\u00a0investigations\u00a0(cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, cerebral computed tomography angiography, and lumbar puncture) were unremarkable, except for the involuntary purposeless movements previously mentioned. During a subsequent admission for recurrent symptoms, the patient was diagnosed with acute appendicitis. Concurrent laboratory evaluation revealed thyrotoxicosis with suppressed TSH, elevated free T4 and T3, and positive TSH-receptor antibodies, confirming Graves' disease. Surgical intervention was postponed due to the risk of thyroid storm, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for stabilization and initiation of antithyroid therapy. Treatment with methimazole, propranolol, cholestyramine, hydrocortisone, and Lugol's iodine led to normalization of thyroid function and complete resolution of hemichorea on follow-up, supporting a causal link to thyrotoxicosis. Hemichorea is rare in patients with hyperthyroidism, but it can be the first manifestation of the condition.\u00a0This clinical case draws attention to an atypical presentation of Graves' disease and its challenges. This initial presentation may experience a delayed diagnosis, as hyperthyroidism is not typically the first consideration, and usually presents with\u00a0other symptoms, such as palpitations, weight loss, heat intolerance, irritability, proptosis, and hyperhidrosis. Early recognition and proper diagnosis are essential, as treating the underlying disease may lead to rapid resolution of chorea and avoid unnecessary treatments.","24":"Large cerebral artery stenosis (LCAS) is a risk factor for ischemic stroke; however, its relationship with kidney function remains unclear. This study aims to explore the association between glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and LCAS. This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study, with data from 1,011 asymptomatic South Korean adults aged \u226545 years with cardiovascular disease risk factors or stroke family history, recruited from the Neurology Clinic or Health Management Center at CHA Bundang Medical Center in Seoul, between March 2008 and December 2014. The independent variable was eGFR, calculated using the CKD-EPI 2009 creatinine-based equation, and the dependent variable was large cerebral artery stenosis (LCAS), defined as \u226550% stenosis or occlusion of intracranial or extracranial cerebral arteries (or both), assessed by MRA. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between eGFR and LCAS, adjusting for demographic factors, cardiovascular risk factors, and biochemical markers. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to assess the dose-response relationship between eGFR and LCAS. Stratified analysis and interaction tests were conducted to evaluate the eGFR-LCAS relationship. Higher eGFR levels were independently associated with lower odds of LCAS. After adjusting for confounding factors, each 1 mL\/min\/1.73 m<sup>2<\/sup> increase in eGFR was associated with a 1% reduction in LCAS risk (OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.00). Compared to the lowest tertile (T1), the highest tertile (T3) was associated with a 39% lower risk of LCAS (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.96). In subgroup analyses, the association was statistically significant in women (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96-0.99; <i>P<\/i> = 0.009) and in statin users (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99; <i>P<\/i> = 0.015). However, the interaction was borderline for sex (<i>P<\/i> interaction = 0.051) and not significant for statin use (<i>P<\/i> interaction = 0.105), and these subgroup findings should be interpreted as exploratory. These findings indicate an association between eGFR and LCAS in this cohort. Subgroup patterns and clinical implications require confirmation in prospective and external cohorts. Kidney function may serve as a risk marker; whether it should inform screening strategies requires confirmation. These findings are derived from a South Korean population with cardiovascular risk factors and require validation in diverse populations and general population settings.","25":"Thoracic disc herniation (TDH) is a spinal condition with significant clinical implications due to its proximity to the spinal cord and unique anatomical challenges. Despite advancements in imaging and surgical techniques, the relationship between herniation characteristics and clinical outcomes remains poorly understood. This study aims to analyze the clinical and radiological features of TDH in a large cohort of surgically treated patients, focusing on volumetric assessments and a novel classification system based on anatomical landmarks. A retrospective review was conducted on 994 patients who underwent surgical treatment for TDH at a single institution over 20 years. Patient demographics, clinical presentations, and radiological characteristics were analyzed. Two systems were used to classify TDH based on radiologic axial area (A, B, and C) and radiologic laterality (central, unilateral, and bilateral, subscripted as X<sub>0<\/sub>, X<sub>1,<\/sub> and X<sub>2<\/sub>, respectively). The ratio of hernia to canal volumes was calculated, and associations between hernia characteristics and symptoms were examined. The mean age was 49.2 years, with a slight female predominance (58.7%). Most herniations (71.5%) occurred in the lower thoracic spine, with T7-T8 being the most common level. Hernias were primarily central (67.4%) and filled an average of 45% of the spinal canal. Type B hernias (intermediate size) were the most frequent (48%), followed by the more prominent type C (32.6%) and the smaller type A (19.4%). Pain was reported by 99.1% of patients, with 65% describing it as severe. Motor deficits were present in 20.1% of patients, sensory deficits in 26.1%, and gait abnormalities in 18.2%. Larger hernias (types B and C) were associated with fewer motor and reflex impairments compared to smaller hernias (type A), potentially reflecting adaptive spinal cord remodeling. Unilateral lesions were linked to a higher likelihood of neurological deficits, while bilateral lesions were associated with increased pain and reduced gait impairment. TDH presents with diverse clinical and radiological features. Despite their size, larger hernias have shown lower odds of neurological impairments, suggesting compensatory mechanisms. This study underscores the importance of volumetric assessments and systematic classification to better understand and manage TDH. Further research is needed to explore the natural history and long-term outcomes of TDH.","26":"The International Pediatric Headache Didactic Series (IPHDS) was developed to provide free, comprehensive pediatric headache education to healthcare professionals worldwide. The objective of this study was to describe the design, implementation, and impact of this prospective educational intervention. Headache is the most common neurological symptom within the pediatric population. Yet, only nine fellowships are offered in pediatric headache medicine. Limitations in access to education and training are often cited as reasons for diagnostic and management barriers. To address this gap, the IPHDS was established in July 2022. IPHDS is a recurring series consisting of 23 biweekly lectures. Lectures are delivered virtually via Zoom and available for asynchronous learning on an open-access website. Lecture topics are based on the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties' curriculum recommendations. Pre- and post-surveys were developed collaboratively by content experts and administered to attendees. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, and qualitative data were analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis. From July 2022 to July 2023, over 480 people signed up for IPHDS. Lecture attendees represented a variety of clinical backgrounds including advanced practice providers (26.4%, n\u2009=\u2009128\/484), MD\/DO headache providers (25.4%, n\u2009=\u2009123\/484), adult headache fellows (12.6%, n\u2009=\u200961\/484), pediatric headache fellows (10.3%, n\u2009=\u200950\/484), residents (8.1%, n\u2009=\u200939\/484), clinical nurses (8.1%, n\u2009=\u200939\/484), MD\/DO neurology (non-headache) providers (2.1%, n\u2009=\u200910\/484), researchers (1.6%, n\u2009=\u20098\/484), medical students (1.4%, n\u2009=\u20097\/484), orofacial pain providers (1.0%, n\u2009=\u20095\/484), psychologists (<1%, n\u2009=\u20093\/484), and pharmacists (<1%, n\u2009=\u20093\/484). Lecture attendees represented nine countries and 31\u2009US states. Median attendance for live lectures was 34.0 people [interquartile range: 28.3-42.5], and median viewership of the posted lectures to date was 79.0 views [interquartile range: 52.0-93.0]. Prior to attending IPHDS, only 56.7% (n\u2009=\u2009230\/406) of participants reported being competent or very competent in headache medicine knowledge. After attending IPHDS, 76.9% (n\u2009=\u200940\/52) of participants reported being competent or very competent in knowledge of headache medicine, as indicated in their post-survey. Similarly, 78.8% (n\u2009=\u200941\/52) of participants indicated that this didactic series moderately or significantly added to their knowledge of pediatric headache medicine. This novel didactic series successfully delivered free pediatric headache education to healthcare professionals worldwide. Furthermore, this didactic series serves as a framework for other subspecialties looking to disseminate education from specialists in the field. IPHDS continues on an annual basis, following the academic calendar year, and now holds continuing medical education accreditation.","27":"ObjectiveTo explore the latent trajectory classes of objective sleep quality in stroke patients and their impact on neurological functional recovery.MethodsA multicenter cluster sampling method was used to recruit 362 stroke patients from the neurology departments of 5 tertiary hospitals in China between November 2023 and July 2024. Baseline data were collected using a general information questionnaire and related scales. Objective sleep data were obtained using ActiGraph GT3X triaxial accelerometers during the acute (T0), recovery (T1), and chronic (T2) phases of stroke. Neurological recovery was assessed at 12\u2009months post-onset (T3) using the modified Rankin Scale. Parallel-process latent class growth modeling was used to identify trajectory classes. Binary logistic regression examined the association between sleep trajectories and neurological recovery.ResultsA total of 306 patients were followed up. Four distinct trajectory classes were identified: Consistently good sleep quality group (34.31%), Short sleep-increased efficiency-improved fragmentation group (49.02%), Long sleep-reduced efficiency-deteriorated fragmentation group (7.84%), and Consistently poor sleep quality group (8.82%). Compared to the consistently good sleep quality group, patients in the Long sleep-reduced efficiency-deteriorated fragmentation group and Consistently poor sleep quality group had 5.728 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.124-15.444) and 6.769 (95% CI: 2.580-17.758) times higher risks of poor neurological recovery, respectively.ConclusionStroke patients exhibit heterogeneous sleep quality trajectories, with differential impacts on neurological recovery. Healthcare providers should implement personalized sleep management strategies to optimize both sleep quality and functional outcomes.","28":"No abstract available","29":"The severe, degenerative muscle condition known as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) typically manifests in early childhood. This study aims to investigate how DMD cases express the genes for Ewing's Tumor-associated Antigen 1 (ETAA1), Topoisomerase II\u03b2-binding protein 1 (TOPBP1), and ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related). A total of 50 ambulatory male patients with DMD attending pediatric neurology clinic at Menoufia University Hospital were included and compared to 25 healthy control males matched for age. General clinical information, neurological information, and laboratory tests were performed. This included measuring serum levels of creatine phosphokinase CPK, human creatine kinase, muscle (CK-mm), human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and quantitative expression of the genes ETAA1, TOPBP1, and ATR. In contrast to those in good health, the expression levels of the ETAA1, TOPBP1, and ATR genes were significantly greater in DMD cases. Additionally blood levels of CPK, CK-mm, LDH, and TOS were significantly higher in DMD than those of healthy individuals. The gene expression of ETAA1, TOPBP1, and ATR is substantially elevated in cases with severe DMD, making them potentially significant indicators of the severity of DMD cases. This study evaluates the expression of DNA damage response genes-ETAA1, TOPBP1, and ATR-in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The results demonstrate that DMD patients have much greater gene expression levels and oxidative stress indicators than healthy controls. These genes show a favorable correlation with clinical severity indicators such as CKMM, CPK, and LDH. Combining the three markers improves diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, indicating their potential as a multi-gene biomarker panel. The findings shed fresh light on DMD etiology by correlating genomic instability to disease progression and identifying possible molecular targets for early detection and future treatment approaches.","30":"This study sought to determine the incidence of Neuralgic Amyotrophy (NA) in the United States of America's health system, most common presenting symptoms, time from symptom onset and time from initial presentation to diagnosis, number and specialty of clinicians seen prior to diagnosis, and specialty of diagnosing clinician. A retrospective chart review study was conducted to identify all patients diagnosed with ICD-10 G54.5 from September 1, 2016 - December 31, 2023. 153 patients with NA diagnoses from 2016-2023 were included. The average incidence of NA in the United States of America's healthcare system was 1.77\/100,000 per year. The most common chief concern upon presentation was shoulder pain, (n\u2009=\u200957, 37.2%) and the most common secondary or tertiary concern was shoulder weakness (n\u2009=\u200941, 26.7%). Average time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 101.3 days (SD\u2009=\u2009155.4; median\u2009=\u200951 days), and from initial presentation to diagnosis was 78.1 days (SD\u2009=\u2009145.6; median\u2009=\u200928 days). Sixty-three patients (41.2%) presented to one other clinician with similar symptoms prior to diagnosis, 37 (24.2%) saw two clinicians, 16 (10.5%) saw three, and 7 (4.6%) saw four or more clinicians. Patients most often initially presented to a family medicine, primary care, or urgent care clinician (n\u2009=\u200961, 39.9%). The most common specialties of diagnosing clinicians were orthopaedic surgery (100 diagnoses, 65.4%), neurology (23 diagnoses, 15%) and neurosurgery (15 diagnoses, 10%). Diagnosis of neuralgic amyotrophy is historically rare, but the incidence may be higher than previously thought. Neuralgic amyotrophy is a debilitating disorder that is often initially unrecognized, ultimately leading to a months-long delay in diagnosis. Over 80% of patients were seen by at least one other clinician before diagnosis, and orthopaedic clinicians were most likely to make the diagnosis. Maintaining a high clinical suspicion while recognizing the common presenting symptoms along with onset and evolution of symptoms would help facilitate timely referral to specialists trained in identifying and managing neuralgic amyotrophy, prevent unnecessary and unproductive appointments preceding the diagnosis, and allow earlier initiation of treatment. Diagnostic Type IV.","31":"In 2025, international neurology celebrates the bicentenary of J.-M. Charcot's birth. As a major medical scientist in Paris and the founder of modern clinical neurology, Charcot became friends with the celebrated literary figure Alphonse Daudet. Discord subsequently intervened, as Daudet, afflicted with tabes dorsalis, was treated by Charcot without success and even underwent suspension therapy that led to serious side effects. Daudet's son, L\u00e9on, blamed Charcot for his own failure in medical school and became a bitter social critic of the French medical system, condemning the hospital hierarchy, including Charcot. Further family discord occurred when L\u00e9on married the granddaughter of Victor Hugo, instead of Charcot's own daughter. Within this background, after Charcot's death in 1893, Alphonse Daudet incorporated Charcot into a fictional account, <i>A la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re,<\/i> one of 3 short stories in his <i>Trois Souvenirs<\/i> (<i>3 Recollections<\/i>). This study dissects Daudet's Charcot depiction where he presents Charcot as mostly silent, passive, and distant within a circus-like atmosphere of disruptive patients, foreign visitors, and interns. The portrait is a striking contrast to the many other first-hand descriptions of Charcot's domineering, autocratic, and patronizing manner. However, the depiction of a quiet and distantly bland master in the fictional office consultation setting is historically anchored in Daudet's life experiences, which included visits to the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, first-hand knowledge of Charcot over many years, and the experience of being a patient with unremitting neurologic disease. The veracity of the actual events is questionable, given the personal antagonism that colored the last years of their lives, but it is also conceivable to see in Charcot a Janus-like figure of dominance and theatrical authority in the teaching amphitheater interfaced with a more passive, reflective observer in the intimacy of an office setting.","32":"Multiple autoimmune syndrome (MAS) is characterized by the coexistence of 3 or more autoimmune disorders in the same individual and is exceptionally rare in childhood. Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) represents 3% to 5% of all multiple sclerosis (MS) cases and is increasingly recognized within the broader spectrum of immune-mediated diseases. We describe 2 pediatric patients fulfilling MAS criteria in association with POMS-one with type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroiditis, and another with rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune thyroiditis. Both exhibited HLA-DRB1*15:01 positivity, Epstein-Barr virus IgG seropositivity, and severe vitamin D deficiency, suggesting shared immunogenetic and environmental risk factors. These cases highlight the potential of POMS to manifest as part of a systemic autoimmune diathesis. Early recognition, proactive screening, and multidisciplinary management are essential. Further multicenter studies and registry-based data are needed to clarify the prevalence, mechanisms, and prognostic implications of MAS in pediatric MS.","33":"A prospective observational study was conducted in a neurology ward between November 2022 and October 2023. The Braden, Waterlow and Jackson\/Cubbin scales were used to assess patients independently within eight hours of admission and daily thereafter. Among the 567 patients included, 37 (6.53%) developed PIs during hospitalisation. The Braden scale demonstrated a sensitivity of 70.27%, specificity of 69.81%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.73. Sensitivity, specificity and AUC values for the Waterlow scale were 89.19%, 67.17% and 0.82, respectively, while the Jackson\/Cubbin scale showed values of 81.08%, 56.23% and 0.70, respectively. In terms of discrimination, pairwise comparisons of the AUC revealed that the Waterlow scale outperformed the Braden scale (Z=2.828; p<0.01) and the Jackson\/Cubbin scale (Z=4.191; p<0.01). No significant difference was found between the Braden and Jackson\/Cubbin scales (Z=1.209; p>0.05). Regarding accuracy, Bayes discriminant analysis indicated that the positive predictive values for the Braden, Waterlow and Jackson\/Cubbin scales were 63.5%, 68.6% and 62.4%, respectively. The accuracy of each scale was assessed using calibration methods. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test revealed that the Waterlow scale exhibited better goodness of fit (\u03c7<sup>2<\/sup>=6.174; p=0.628) compared with the Braden scale (\u03c7<sup>2<\/sup>=13.794; p=0.087) and the Jackson\/Cubbin scale (\u03c7<sup>2<\/sup>=10.982; p=0.203). The calibration curve demonstrated that the predicted values from the Waterlow scale showed the closest agreement with the observed values. In this study, the predictive power of the Braden, Waterlow and Jackson\/Cubbin scales was found to be moderate. The Waterlow scale was superior to the other two scales in terms of both discrimination and accuracy, offering better predictive performance for stroke patients.","34":"Hoarding disorder is defined as persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value. Hoarding is associated with biopsychosocial distress and reduced quality of life, and although it is often associated with obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, hoarding is also encountered in cases of neurodegeneration. Assessments of hoarding behavior traditionally involve a comprehensive evaluation that may be challenging in clinical settings. The authors developed a simplified hoarding screen for patients with neurobehavioral disorders. The Single-Item Hoarding Screen (SIHS) is a single-item questionnaire. In total, 135 patients from the University of Colorado Behavioral Neurology Clinic were surveyed; caregivers filled out the SIHS. Patients' diagnoses included a range of neurobehavioral disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, primary progressive aphasia, major neurocognitive disorder not otherwise specified, and minor neurocognitive disorder not otherwise specified. The mean age of the patients was 70.9 years, and 39% were female. Among the patients surveyed, 10% and 13% of caregivers (23% total) answered yes and maybe, respectively, to the question on the SIHS. Yes responses on this screen were significantly associated with higher scores on the established Hoarding Rating Scale, compared with maybe responses. Statistical analyses revealed significant correlations between hoarding behaviors and neuropsychiatric symptom severity as well as caregiver well-being. These results suggest the potential benefits of a tool containing only a single item to screen for hoarding behavior in neurobehavioral disorders. Future research may focus on refining and validating the SIHS.","35":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic and its related restrictions were associated with changes in emergency department (ED) utilization, with reductions reported in many regions worldwide. In Brazil, where EDs often serve non-urgent cases, the long-term impact remains unclear. Therefore, this study evaluated ED utilization trends across pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods in a large tertiary hospital. Methods This retrospective observational study analyzed all ED visits recorded at the University of Campinas Clinics Hospital, a tertiary care referral hospital in southeastern Brazil, from January 2018 to December 2024. Data from the electronic medical record system were categorized into pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. Temporal trends in total, adult, and pediatric ED visits, as well as by medical specialty, were evaluated using joinpoint regression (Joinpoint Regression Program, version 4.9.0.1). Results Between Jan\/18-Feb\/20\u00a0(pre-pandemic), Mar\/20-May\/23 (pandemic), and Jun\/23-Dec\/24 (post-pandemic), 388,733 ED visits were recorded, including 329,111 adults and 59,622 pediatrics. Total visits declined by 39.5% from 2019 (69,519 visits) to 2020 (41,991), with reductions of 34.8% among adults (56,813 to 37,013) and 60.8% among children (12,706 to 4,978). Joinpoint analysis for total visits identified a sharp negative trend at the onset of the pandemic (p = 0.03), followed by a gradual recovery that did not reach pre-pandemic levels by 2024 (77.8% of baseline; pre-pandemic mean = 70,701; visits in 2024 = 54,987). Temporal patterns varied by specialty: neurology and some surgical specialties showed growth, while internal medicine, psychiatry, and ophthalmology exhibited distinct fluctuations and incomplete recovery. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic caused a marked and prolonged disruption in ED services utilization. Although visit volumes gradually recovered, they remained below pre-pandemic levels, with variable patterns across age groups and specialties. These findings highlight lasting shifts in healthcare-seeking behavior and the need for adaptive planning for future health crises.","36":"Thyroid storm, also known as thyrotoxic crisis, is an uncommon and potentially life-threatening condition that can cause metabolic, cardiovascular and neurological complications. Thyrotoxic crisis often develops in the context of untreated or poorly controlled hyperthyroidism and is typically precipitated by acute stressors such as infection, surgery, or trauma. While the progression from hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism is itself an uncommon clinical occurrence, the emergence of thyroid storm in this setting is sporadic. Such a case highlights the importance of being aware of\u00a0atypical presentations of thyroid storm. The association between thyrotoxicosis and Moyamoya disease has been reported. There is no published case report or review describing Moyamoya syndrome in association with the transformation of hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism. A 28-year-old patient with a known history of\u00a0hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on SGLT2 inhibitors, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and\u00a0mixed anxiety-depressive disorder presented to the accident and emergency department with palpitations, chest discomfort and focal seizures reported by her partner and family. Initial blood tests showed euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (eDKA) and a very high thyroid function test suggestive of thyrotoxicosis. A CT of the brain showed a developing right frontal lobe infarct. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate despite ICU input.\u00a0A repeat brain CT suggested Moyamoya syndrome. The patient died despite early detection and thorough, multidisciplinary care input from endocrinology, neurology, stroke\u00a0and critical care teams. This example underpins the poor prognosis of Moyamoya syndrome, even with early identification and management, the need for multispecialty cooperation, and the difficulties in treating the uncommon complication of thyrotoxicosis.","37":"Genetic testing is recommended for all children with global developmental delay or intellectual disability (GDD\/ID) without a clearly-identifiable acquired etiology, as it leads to a rare disease diagnosis up to 40% of the time and has implications for medical management and family planning. However, families often experience years-long journeys from the time of initial presentation with developmental concerns to the time of genetic testing, if it is completed at all. An implementation science-based approach to understanding determinants of genetic testing for GDD\/ID is ideal for identifying key targets for future strategies to improve uptake. The Health Equity Implementation Framework was used to adapt a semi-structured qualitative interview guide from a previous study. Interviews were conducted with 18 caregivers of children with GDD\/ID who had been evaluated in pediatric neurology clinics at a single tertiary care institution. Over half of participants (55.6%) self-identified with at least one historically underrepresented demographic (33.3% Black\/African American, 27.8% with high school or less education, 27.8% with high neighborhood-level area deprivation, 11.1% rural). Content analysis was performed using inductive and deductive coding. Content saturation was reached. Six themes reflected multilevel factors influencing uptake of genetic testing: (1) caregiver search for answers, advocacy, and empowerment; (2) real-world healthcare accessibility; (3) financial strain and insurance coverage; (4) trust and communication with providers; (5) racial disparities and discrimination; and (6) social support and community networks. Most caregivers viewed genetic testing positively. Pathways to testing were often complex and uneven. Social determinants (insurance, employment flexibility, rurality, family structure, and racism) shaped families' ability to access timely testing and follow-up. System-level barriers such as uncoordinated referrals, inconsistent provider knowledge, and long wait times compounded these challenges. Together, these factors created unequal diagnostic journeys for families, even within the same health system. We identified caregiver-informed targets to improve the quality and equity of care for patients with GDD\/ID including insurance coverage, diagnostic efficiency, resource availability and awareness, healthcare navigation, and cultural humility. These targets inform the development and adaptation of implementation strategies to improve uptake and reduce the protracted time of the diagnosis and genetic testing journey. Not applicable.","38":"The objectives were to evaluate the prevalence of comorbidities at the time of multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis in a Finnish cross-sectional cohort and to analyze whether comorbidities at diagnosis associate with clinical characteristics, treatment delays, initial disease-modifying treatment (DMT) choice, DMT persistence, and disease activity. Patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) were recruited during their appointments at the neurology outpatient clinic of the Oulu University Hospital, Finland, between the years 2018 and 2022. The data was gathered from the hospital medical records. The study cohort consisted of 421 Finnish RRMS patients, of whom 51.8% had at least one or more comorbidity at the time of MS diagnosis. Depression (16.2%) and migraine (11.6%) were the most common comorbidities. Medium-efficacy injectable DMTs (interferon-\u03b2 and glatiramer acetate) were associated with lower treatment persistence in patients with any comorbidity or psychiatric comorbidity during the 4-year follow-up. Among patients with psychiatric comorbidity, the rate of DMT discontinuation was high shortly after the DMT initiation, and the annualized relapse rate at the start of the DMT was higher compared with those without psychiatric comorbidity (1.3 [SD 0.78] vs. 1.1 [SD 0.74], p = 0.026). Comorbidities, especially psychiatric diseases, are associated with lower persistence on injectable DMTs. As comorbidities complicate the treatment of RRMS, it is crucial to identify their role from early on.","39":"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that impairs gait and quality of life. Current pharmacological and surgical treatment strategies\u00a0cannot eliminate FOG. The supplementary motor area (SMA) is an important part of the motor network that contributing to generate anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) and becomes impaired in FOG. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, can regulate the SMA and its connections with other brain regions. It may serve as a valuable adjunctive therapeutic approach in alleviating FOG in PD. The aim of this trial is to investigate efficacy and safety of high-frequency SMA-rTMS on FOG in PD patients and reveal possible neural mechanism of this intervention via task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tb-fMRI). We will conduct a double-blind, randomized sham-controlled clinical trial. Up to 52 PD patients with FOG will be recruited from the department of neurology or outpatient departments, and randomized to sham or active rTMS group in 1:1 ratio. 12 sessions with 10\u00a0Hz stimulation over the SMA are delivered 3 times a week for 4\u00a0weeks. The primary outcome is the change of New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOGQ) scores from baseline to post-stimulation. Secondary outcomes include the clinical scales of PD motor and non-motor symptoms, quality of PD's life scale and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). Besides, objective gait parameters obtained with wearable device and fMRI are also collected as secondary outcomes. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4\u00a0weeks, and 8\u00a0weeks in the \"off\" state. This study will aid us to explore the short and long-term effects of 10\u00a0Hz rTMS over SMA on FOG in patients with PD and its safety. Combining task imagery paradigm and fMRI, the study will reveal underlying therapeutic mechanism of rTMS, which may provide evidence for future developments of therapeutic approaches. This trial has been registered in China Clinical Trials Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2100049370).

This study aimed to systematically map the functional and structural network disconnection patterns underlying PSCI, elucidate the relationship between network disconnection and cognitive status-particularly the mediating role of WMH-and identify potential neuromodulation targets based on the disconnection maps. In a cohort of 376 mild-to-moderate first acute ischemic stroke patients without pre-stroke dementia, we employed connectome-based lesion-symptom mapping (CLSM) to construct comprehensive disconnection maps derived from infarct and WMH lesions. The distinctiveness was validated against an independent cohort of 78 cerebral small vessel disease patients. CLSM-derived lesion impact scores were analyzed using regression models to assess their domain-specific cognitive relationships and using mediation modeling to quantify the mediating effects of WMH. Potential neuromodulation targets were subsequently identified based on the disconnection patterns. Results revealed that spatially heterogeneous infarcts and WMH converge on functionally\/structurally coherent disconnection patterns through distinct pathological mechanisms, with attention and processing speed (APS) deficits emerging as the most sensitive domain. Lesion impact scores were significantly correlated with cognitive deficits and demonstrated greater predictive contribution for 3-month cognitive outcomes than traditional volumetric measures. WMH-induced disconnections significantly mediated the relationship between infarct and PSCI\/APS deficits. The left temporo-parieto-occipital junction could be considered a potential neuromodulation target for PSCI. This study establishes a network-level pathophysiological framework for PSCI, demonstrating distinct yet synergistic roles of acute and chronic vascular lesions.","42":"Blepharospasm-related dry eye is a complex multifactorial comorbidity involving neural, ocular surface, and psychological factors, currently facing core challenges including unclear pathogenesis, ambiguous clinical assessment and diagnostic criteria, non-standardized treatment, and lack of multidisciplinary collaboration. The article proposes that a \"dry eye-blepharospasm\" vicious cycle may exist with significant individual differences; symptom overlap easily leads to misdiagnosis without unified diagnostic standards or objective indicators; while botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) is effective, controversies remain regarding dosage and efficacy, necessitating standardization of basic treatments like artificial tears; and establishing a multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) model is urgently needed in clinical practice. Consequently, the authors suggest elucidating mechanisms through multidimensional approaches such as animal models and functional imaging, classifying patients into three subtypes (sensory-triggered, movement-originated, and crossover types) based on onset sequence to establish standardized diagnostic processes, standardizing BTX-A administration with a \"low-dose, multi-point, superficial injection\" strategy and combination therapies, integrating ophthalmology, neurology, rehabilitation, and psychology resources to build an MDT model, and utilizing artificial intelligence and mobile health technologies for individualized long-term management. Future research should focus on the interaction between neuroinflammation and ocular surface injury, and explore precise combination strategies of BTX-A with novel anti-dry eye medications.","43":"Acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) of the central nervous system in children present a diagnostic challenge due to overlapping presentations. Differentiating monophasic from potentially recurrent conditions, such as pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS), myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), and other seronegative ADS, is essential for treatment and prognosis. This study aimed to characterize the initial presentation of pediatric ADS and evaluate the evolution of diagnosis over time to better guide treatment. A retrospective study of 59 children with ADS diagnosed at a tertiary pediatric center in Italy (2012-2024) was conducted. Initial classifications included MS, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), optic neuritis (ON), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), or \"Indeterminate\". Final diagnoses were categorized as MS, MOGAD, or \"Other\" demyelinating conditions. Demographic, clinical, MRI, CSF, and outcome were analyzed. Statistical comparisons among groups used Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests (p < 0.05). At final diagnosis, older age at onset, absence of preceding infection and characteristic MRI findings (periventricular\/callosal lesions, cerebellar involvement) were more frequent in MS group. Younger age, preceding infection, fever, irritability, and cortical involvement were associated with MOGAD. Nearly one-third of final MS cases (29%) were initially CIS or ON, while no ADEM cases converted to MS. \"Other\" ADS (non-MS\/MOG-IgG antibody negative patients) showed more severe initial disability (p = 0.01). Transition to adult neurology was significantly higher in MS (p < 0.001). these findings underscore the heterogeneity of pediatric ADS at onset and the value of accurate acute management and longitudinal follow-up to refine diagnosis and guide treatment.","44":"This study aimed to examine the relationship between psychological resilience and self-esteem among healthy adolescents who have siblings diagnosed with epilepsy. This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted between May and November 2024 at Mu\u015f State Hospital. The sample consisted of 126 healthy adolescents aged 12-18 years who had siblings diagnosed with epilepsy and were receiving follow-up care at the pediatric neurology outpatient clinic. Data were collected using a Personal Information Form, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM). The mean CYRM score was 41.32\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.87, indicating moderate psychological resilience, and the mean RSES score was 2.11\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.75, indicating moderate self-esteem. Psychological resilience scores were significantly higher among girls and adolescents from higher-income families, as well as those whose parents had higher educational levels and professional occupations. Self-esteem levels were higher among adolescents whose parents were university graduates or civil servants and lower among those from low-income families. Emotional responses during siblings' seizures were also associated with both outcomes; adolescents reporting compassion or sadness demonstrated higher psychological resilience and self-esteem than those reporting pity. A moderate negative correlation was found between CYRM and RSES scores, reflecting the inverse scoring structure of the RSES, in which lower scores indicate higher self-esteem. Adolescents who have siblings with epilepsy exhibit moderate levels of psychological resilience and self-esteem compared with normative adolescent samples. Sociodemographic characteristics and emotional responses to seizures play an important role in shaping these outcomes, highlighting the need for psychosocial support strategies to strengthen resilience and self-esteem.","45":"Previous studies suggest that blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption may play a role in the pathophysiology of vessel rupture in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Here, in a cross-sectional cohort study, we apply contrast-enhanced 3 Tesla MRI to test the hypothesis that the BBB is damaged in patients with CAA, and to determine whether BBB leakage is associated with hemorrhagic brain injury in CAA. Parenchymal BBB leakage rate (Ki) was assessed in the cortex and white matter with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI and quantified with pharmacokinetic modeling. Leptomeningeal BBB leakage was assessed visually on post-contrast heavily T2-weighted FLAIR images. Cortical cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) were assessed on susceptibility-weighted images. Analyses included descriptive statistics, group comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test, and Spearman's rank correlation for associations with imaging markers. 25 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable CAA without prior intracerebral hemorrhage and 19 age- and sex-matched controls were included. In patients with CAA, BBB leakage rates were lower in the cortex (4.2*10-4 min-1 vs 5.6*10-4 min-1; p=0.004) and in the white matter (1.2*10-4 min-1 vs 2.1*10-4 min-1; p<0.001) compared with controls. The presence of leptomeningeal enhancement was higher in patients with CAA (68%) compared with controls (47%) (p=0.007). Within the group with CAA, we did not find an correlation between number of cortical leakage and cortical CMBs and (Spearman's p=0.06, p=0.79) or number of foci of leptomeningeal enhancement and cSS hemisphere score (Spearman's p=0.30, p=0.15). Our results suggest that global parenchymal gadolinium extravasation across the BBB is lower in patients with CAA compared with controls. This observation can be explained in terms of limited capillary blood perfusion and\/or raising the possibility that vascular amyloid-\u03b2 deposition impairing molecular transport across the BBB. In contrast, focal leptomeningeal enhancement was higher in CAA reflecting vessel wall infiltration.","46":"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately 1 in 10,000-15,000 females, most often caused by loss-of-function mutations in <i>MECP2<\/i>. Until the recent approval of trofinetide, management relied exclusively on symptomatic treatment and multidisciplinary supportive care. The therapeutic landscape is now undergoing a rapid shift, driven by multiple gene therapy approaches designed to restore functional MeCP2 expression and achieve true disease modification. As these therapies progress toward potential regulatory approval, neurologists will play central roles in identifying eligible patients, counseling families, supporting clinical trial enrollment, delivering treatments, monitoring long-term outcomes, and advocating for equitable access. This review provides neurologists with the essential framework needed to understand and navigate this evolving field. We examine in detail the two most advanced gene replacement therapies currently in clinical trials. TSHA-102 uses an intrathecally delivered miniMECP2 transgene regulated by a microRNA-based autoregulatory system, whereas NGN-401 delivers full-length <i>MECP2<\/i> via intracerebroventricular administration using a synthetic expression-feedback circuit. Both approaches have shown encouraging early efficacy, with treated children achieving developmental gains that exceed natural history expectations. However, they differ substantially in molecular design, regulatory control, delivery method, and safety considerations. We also highlight challenges unique to RTT gene therapy, including the narrow therapeutic window between insufficient expression and MeCP2 overexpression toxicity, the impact of X-chromosome inactivation mosaicism, and lessons learned from a fatal hyperinflammatory adverse event. Beyond AAV-mediated gene replacement, we review next-generation strategies in preclinical development-CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing for permanent mutation correction, ADAR-based RNA editing, translation readthrough for nonsense variants, and X-chromosome reactivation to restore endogenous <i>MECP2<\/i> expression. Finally, we address key translational considerations such as optimal timing of intervention, dosing constraints, outcome measurement in severely impaired populations, long-term safety surveillance, and barriers to broad and equitable access. The RTT gene therapy experience serves as a model for precision medicine in other monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders, illustrating both the transformative promise and the substantial complexities of translating genetic science into meaningful clinical benefit.","47":"Cerebral venous thrombosis is an uncommon cause of stroke, often affecting young women and frequently associated with prothrombotic factors such as exogenous hormones. Estrogen therapy, used in contraception or hormone replacement, is a known risk factor for thrombosis. Although transdermal estrogen is thought to confer lower thrombotic risk than oral formulations, it is not risk-free. We report a case of isolated cortical vein thrombosis in a young woman on a transdermal estradiol patch. A 32-year-old woman on a low-dose transdermal estradiol patch for contraception presented with acute headache, hemiparesis, and Wernicke's aphasia. Imaging revealed a left parietal infarction and thrombosis of a cortical vein in the left temporo-occipital region. The hypercoagulability work-up was unremarkable. She was treated with anticoagulation and supportive care, with gradual neurological improvement. This case highlights that even transdermal estrogen, often considered safer, can contribute to cerebral venous thrombosis. Oral estrogen therapy substantially increases venous thromboembolism risk (2- to 4-fold), whereas transdermal 17\u03b2-estradiol has a lower impact on coagulation. Collaboration between endocrinology and neurology is vital in managing hormone-related thrombosis. Isolated cortical vein thrombosis is a rare stroke etiology that can be precipitated by estrogen therapy. Transdermal estradiol bypasses hepatic first-pass metabolism, yet it is not devoid of thrombosis risk. Clinicians should remain vigilant in prescribing and monitoring hormone therapies, balancing benefits with individualized risk assessment. This case highlights the importance of recognizing endocrine factors in unusual thrombotic events and tailoring hormone regimens to minimize vascular complications.","48":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1212\/NE9.0000000000200253.].","49":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1212\/NE9.0000000000200169.].","50":"Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is an acute, immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy that often presents with rapidly progressive, symmetrical weakness and areflexia, typically following an infectious illness. Its recognition may be delayed in patients with underlying diabetic neuropathy due to overlapping sensory symptoms. We present the case of a 36-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic distal neuropathic pain who developed acute bilateral lower-extremity paralysis after a self-limited viral illness. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed albuminocytologic dissociation, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) excluded cord compression. The diagnosis of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) was established, and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) led to clinical improvement. This case underscores the importance of collaboration between family medicine, emergency, and neurology in the early identification and management of GBS, even in the presence of comorbid neuropathies.","51":"An ongoing pragmatic, randomized, unblinded clinical trial compares pimavanserin and quetiapine for psychosis in Lewy body diseases over 6 months (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u200960).

It examines the biochemical and metabolic properties of vitamin D, as well as the challenges of standardizing 25(OH)D measurements and the variability of threshold values across populations. It discusses ambiguities in scientific data and the need to consider individual factors when interpreting vitamin D levels. This review is unique in its comprehensive approach to analyzing the effects of vitamin D not only on bone health but also on immune and metabolic functions, which broadens ever evolving understanding of the clinical significance of vitamin D. This work emphasizes the importance of personalized recommendations for vitamin D dosing and prescription based on current clinical data and scientific standards. Performed analysis highlights the need for personalized vitamin D supplementation to reach and maintain blood levels between 30 and 60 ng\/mL, noting that higher levels might be necessary for people with genetic or acquired resistance. These insights substantiate the development of evidence-based, personalized clinical strategies for the prevention and treatment of vitamin D deficiency-related disorders. The synthesized data offer significant implications for advancing research and clinical practice in endocrinology, obstetrics, dermatology, neurology and immunology.","54":"Obstructive hydrocephalus is a critical radiographic finding requiring emergent treatment. Its identification on head CT by an AI model could facilitate sooner life-saving interventions, although there are common co-occurring findings, including intracranial hemorrhage, that can confound this interpretation. This external validation assessed the accuracy of an AI model at identifying obstructive hydrocephalus, including in the presence or absence of other findings. This retrospective cohort included 177 thin (\u2264\u20091.5\u2009mm) series and 194 thick (>\u20091.5 and \u2264\u20095\u2009mm) series from 200 non-contrast head CT cases. These cases were obtained from patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200918 years at 5 hospitals in the United States. Each case was interpreted independently by up to three neuroradiologists. Each series was then interpreted by the AI model. The AI model performed with an area under the curve of 0.988 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.971-0.998) on thin series and 0.986 (95% CI: 0.969-0.997) on thick series. These results were broadly maintained in subgroups for the presence or absence of intracranial hemorrhage, parenchymal abnormality, and ventricular drain, and across demographic and scanner manufacturer subgroups. The AI model accurately identified obstructive hydrocephalus in this dataset. Its performance in subgroup analyses reflected its robustness. Question Can an artificial intelligence model accurately identify obstructive hydrocephalus on head computed tomography, including in the presence or absence of common co-occurring imaging findings? Findings This model accurately identified obstructive hydrocephalus on thin and thick series, including in the presence or absence of intracranial hemorrhage, parenchymal abnormality, and ventricular drain. Clinical relevance This model could assist with triaging abnormal cases, enabling earlier identification and management of obstructive hydrocephalus. Its maintained performance with or without co-occurring findings suggests it specifically identifies obstructive hydrocephalus rather than these findings.","55":"Here, we present a case of Bickerstaff's brain stem encephalitis secondary to suspected campylobacter infection.

To evaluate the frequency, characteristics, and severity of cognitive sequelae in patients with a history of NC. We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive study at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery in Mexico City, between 2022 and 2024, involving 105 patients with a history of neurocysticercosis who had no viable parasites at the time of inclusion. Patients were categorized into three groups: parenchymal NC with a single calcification, parenchymal NC with multiple calcifications, and healed extraparenchymal NC who, at the time of NC diagnosis, had intracranial hypertension requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Results were compared to those from a healthy control group, matched with patients by age, sex and educational level. The results highlight a significant cognitive impairment in patients with a history of NC compared to controls: MMSE: 22 (Boppr\u00e9 et al., 2001- (Tseng et al., 2024) vs. 26 (Tseng et al., 2024- (Helmstaedter and Witt, 2017), p < 0.0001; MoCA: 20 (Tombaugh and McIntyre, 1992; Aguilar-Navarro et al., 2018; Cervigni et al., 2022; Del Brutto et al., 2019; Boppr\u00e9 et al., 2001; Rodrigues et al., 2012; Rabearisoa et al., 2024) vs. 25 (Rabearisoa et al., 2024; Hamamoto Filho et al., 2019; Tseng et al., 2024; Koivisto et al., 2013; Xiao et al., 2022; Helmstaedter and Witt, 2017), p < 0.0001. When comparing the three groups of patients, MMSE results showed a higher frequency of dementia in the patients with history of extraparenchmal NC (18 %) compared to the patients with history of parenchymal NC (0 %), p=0.001, while frequency of mild cognitive impairment was higher in the parenchymal group (78 %) vs. extraparenchymal grup (47.3 %), p=0.003. Notably, cognitive function was not influenced by the presence of active epilepsy, its treatment, or prior pharmacological or surgical interventions specific to NC. The MMSE and MoCA scores showed a significant positive correlation when all individuals included in the study were taken into account (r = 0.65, p < 0.0001), and this correlation remained significant when each patient subgroup was analyzed separately. The results of this work indicate that NC is associated with substantial cognitive sequelae, that should be recognized and addressed as part of comprehensive patient care.","57":"Functional\/dissociative seizures are seizures that mimic epileptic seizures in their presentation and are often mistaken for them. Clinical recognition of these seizures presents a challenge and misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment, increasing the risk of complications. To address this, we conducted a study involving 45 young neurology residents from the Czech Republic and Slovakia who had no specialized training in epilepsy or functional neurological disorders. Our goal was to determine whether a brief training in selected semiological features of functional\/dissociative seizures (FDS) would efficiently teach them to differentiate between FDS and epileptic seizures (ES) in a clinical setting. A set of 10 clinical signs characteristic of FDS was selected based on Evidence-Based Practice for the Clinical Assessment of Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (Baslet et al., 2021). Initially, participants identified epileptic seizures and FDS in 30 video recordings without any prior instruction. Subsequently, they received a 15-minute educational session focused on selected semiological features of FDS. Then the same 30 seizure videos were shown again to assess their recognition abilities. No EEG recordings were shown. Following this educational intervention, participants' accuracy in distinguishing FDS from ES significantly improved from 77% before training to 89% after training (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Importantly, recognition of epileptic seizures remained stable at 54% before and 53% after the training. We demonstrated the effectiveness of a concise, targeted education on FDS semiological signs for clinical practice.","58":"Insomnia is increasingly recognized as a disorder with complex metabolic underpinnings. We investigated the changes in fecal metabolite levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), octopamine (OA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and elaidic acid (EA) in patients with sleep disorders, as well as their correlations with insomnia severity. Sixty participants were divided into two groups, with thirty patients with sleep disorders hospitalized in the Department of Neurology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University (October 2024-March 2025) and 30 healthy controls recruited during the same period. Fecal samples were collected from all participants, and metabolite levels were analyzed via untargeted metabolomics analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The Chinese version of the Insomnia Severity Index (C-ISI) was employed to evaluate insomnia severity, and the correlations between insomnia severity and these four metabolites were subjected to statistical analysis. Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed significant metabolic differences between groups. The experimental group showed significantly lower levels of 5-HIAA (FC = 0.947, P\u202f=\u202f0.020) and OA (FC = 0.953, P\u202f<\u202f0.001), but higher OEA (FC = 1.101, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) and EA (FC = 1.026, P\u202f<\u202f0.001). C-ISI scores correlated negatively with 5-HIAA (r\u202f=\u202f-0.380, P\u202f=\u202f0.003) and OA (r\u202f=\u202f-0.448, P\u202f<\u202f0.001), and positively with OEA (r\u202f=\u202f0.500, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) and EA (r\u202f=\u202f0.408, P\u202f=\u202f0.001). These fecal metabolites associate with insomnia severity and may serve as potential biomarkers for understanding its pathophysiology and developing interventions.","59":"Down Syndrome Regression Disorder (DSRD) is an acute neurocognitive regression in individuals with Down syndrome (DS), causing a profound loss of acquired skills. DSRD increases demands on caregivers, to sleep disturbances, financial distress, and negative impacts on caregiver-reported social connections and perceived social support. The goal of this study was to characterize the caregiver-reported impacts of DSRD on social relationships by comparing their experiences to those of caregivers of individuals with DS and other neurological disorders (DSN). This is a narrative burden-of-care study, not a network study. Using cross-sectional study design, caregivers of individuals with DSRD (n\u2009=\u2009228) and DSN (n\u2009=\u2009137) were recruited from a neurology clinic and a DSRD Facebook support group. Participants completed the DSRD Caregiver Distress Survey (CDS), which included four qualitative, open-ended questions focused on self-perception of adult friendships, social relationship impact, spouse\/partner impact, and perceived shrinkage of social world. Responses were analyzed using thematic coding; resulting theme frequencies summarize caregiver-reported perceptions and narratives and do not represent objectively measured social network structure. In the DSRD cohort, a high-level overview revealed that 65.66% of responses reported a negative impact on adult friendships, while 71.21% reported a negative impact on social relationships. A negative impact on spouse\/partner relationships was reported in 51.53% of responses, and a perceived shrinkage of social world was found in 52.82%. Caregivers in the DSRD group were significantly more likely to report \"Social Withdrawal and Isolation\" (43.2% vs. 17.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.006), \"Loss of Community Participation and\/or Support\" (16.7% vs 4.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.043) and a \"Perceived Enduring Loss of Social Connections\" (35.3% vs. 8.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.002) compared to the DSN group. This study's findings reveal a significant and complex process of perceived social disengagement among caregivers describing social withdrawal and loss of social connections that they experienced as enduring. The results emphasize the need for early interventions that address the individual's needs but also address the caregiver's social and mental health to prevent perceived long-term social isolation.","60":"Mutations in the transglutaminase 6 gene (TGM6) are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 35 (SCA35), and cases have been reported across diverse ethnic groups. We report the first documented case of SCA35 in Saudi Arabia, together with a focused literature review. A 35-year-old Saudi man presented to a neurology clinic with severe gait instability following nonspecific symptoms, including unintentional weight loss, dysphagia, abdominal pain, and intermittent diplopia. No family history of ataxia or similar neurological disease was noted. The condition progressed with neuropsychiatric manifestations (adjustment disorder, generalized myalgia, fibromyalgia) and upper motor neuron and extrapyramidal signs. He was admitted for further evaluation. A comprehensive diagnostic work-up, including cerebrospinal fluid studies, multiplex polymerase chain reaction, and nerve conduction studies, ruled out celiac disease, Wilson's disease, and demyelinating diseases. Brain and full-spine magnetic resonance imaging showed no cerebellar atrophy or spinal cord abnormalities. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous splice-site mutation in TGM6 (c.850\u2009+\u20091G\u2009>\u2009A), consistent with autosomal dominant SCA35. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of SCA35 in the Middle East. This case underscores the challenges in diagnosing this condition, as patients may present with atypical features, such as dysphagia. Our findings enhance the current understanding of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and genetic landscape of SCA35 to improve the diagnosis and management of this rare disorder.","61":"Primary spinal infections - including spondylodiscitis, vertebral osteomyelitis and epidural abscess - are increasingly prevalent and clinically heterogeneous, yet no standardized assessment or treatment guidelines currently exist. This position paper proposes a structured framework to support clinical evaluation and management and to guide future trials. Based on a comprehensive literature review and expert consensus, the authors identify four core domains essential for spinal infection evaluation: Stability, Neurology, Infection, and Morbidity (SNIM). Stability is assessed through clinical and radiographic indicators such as vertebral destruction, deformity, and pain. Neurological deficits-including radicular weakness or myelopathy-remain key indications for decompression, supported by imaging of neural compression. Infection control depends on accurate pathogen identification, targeted antimicrobial therapy, and, when indicated, surgical debridement or abscess drainage. Morbidity, including age, frailty and comorbidities, modifies treatment strategies and influences conservative and surgical outcomes, necessitating tailored, risk-adapted approaches. Building on these domains, the paper formulates testable hypotheses related to surgical interventions and introduces a conceptual treatment algorithm designed to reduce clinical heterogeneity and inform prospective study design. The SNIM framework is presented as a preliminary model intended to harmonize terminology, support trial development, and structure future research. While not a validated classification system, it provides a foundation for stratifying patients and exploring outcome-relevant variables. The proposed algorithm reflects current expert interpretation and is offered as a hypothesis-generating tool to be refined through collaborative validation efforts. This paper aims to stimulate ongoing research and multidisciplinary engagement in the evolving field of spinal infection management.","62":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the most pressing challenges in contemporary neurology, with growing evidence highlighting the limitations of the amyloid hypothesis and monomodal therapies. This editorial advocates for a shift toward multidimensional research and therapeutic frameworks that integrate molecular, electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and behavioral data. Emphasis is placed on the potential of microRNA-based biomarkers, electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, and non-invasive methods to improve early diagnosis. Emerging multimodal treatment strategies - including immunotherapy, neurostimulation, and nutraceuticals - are discussed alongside ethical and regulatory challenges in implementing novel interventions. The authors propose an integrated, patient-centered model that combines precision medicine with preventive approaches rooted in lifestyle, digital biomarkers, and AI-powered personalization. A paradigm shift toward systemic, translational, and ethically grounded strategies is urgently needed to meet the growing burden of AD.","63":"Post-stroke patients need support from their caregivers to adapt to changing lifestyles. Difficulty meeting their existing needs increases the care burden and reduces the quality of care and life. To examine the care preparedness and needs of caregivers of patients diagnosed with stroke. A cross-sectional study design was employed. Study data were collected in the neurology units of a university hospital between January 1 and May 31, 2024 with the participation of 139 caregivers. Data were analysed using independent samples t-test, One-Way ANOVA, and multiple linear regression analyses. The mean age of patients diagnosed with stroke was 62.87\u2009\u00b1\u200914.31\u2009years, 64.7% were male, and 69.1% were diagnosed recently. The mean age of the caregivers was 48.40\u2009\u00b1\u200915.82\u2009years, 61.2% were female, and the preparedness for caregiving scale means were 21.44\u2009\u00b1\u20097.22. It was found that care preparedness was associated with patient characteristics, such as age that was \u2265\u200965, comorbid diseases, diabetes mellitus and caregiver characteristics such as female gender and having care experience. The study showed that the presence of comorbid diseases in the patient and having difficulty in caregiving explained 13.2% of the variance in the level of caregivers' care preparedness (p\u2009=\u20090.001). The most common needs of caregivers during the care process were preventing falls (64.0%), patient mobility (57.6%), having information on monitoring secondary stroke symptoms (51.1%), receiving physiotherapy support (45.3%), coping with stress (40.3%), and resting (33.1%). In addition, the needs that caregivers had the most difficulty meeting were positioning, monitoring secondary stroke symptoms, understanding medical terms, management of swallowing difficulties, psychotherapy, and receiving voluntary\/paid caregiver support. The study emphasises the need for comprehensive evaluation of the care needs of post-stroke caregivers and targeted interventions specific to these needs.","64":"Recurrent ischemic stroke (RIS) is a significant challenge in Malaysia, affecting approximately 33% of patients. However, studies using artificial intelligence (AI) to predict this event using real-world data remain very limited. This study aimed to develop and evaluate Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and RUSBoost models for predicting recurrent ischemic stroke using real-world data from the Malaysian National Neurology Registry. We established a retrospective study of 7,697 enrolled patients registered in the National Neurology Registry in Malaysia (2009-2016). We developed and evaluated several machine learning models, including SVM, KNN, and RUSBoost, to predict recurrent RIS. The Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to the training data to handle the imbalanced data. Ten-fold cross-validation was applied to assess the robustness and accuracy of the models, and performance was evaluated using criteria of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Among the evaluated machine learning models, RUSBoost demonstrated the strongest and most clinically relevant performance when assessed on validation (test) folds under stratified ten-fold cross-validation, achieving an AUROC of 0.943, sensitivity of 86.5%, and a favourable balance between sensitivity and PPV of 40.2% on the original imbalanced dataset. Although the application of SMOTE during training improved model discrimination for RUSBoost (training-fold AUROC\u2009=\u20090.986). The SHAP analysis showed that age, race, glucose level, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and duration of diabetes were the most significant factors linked to an increased risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. This study demonstrates that applying machine learning models on real-world clinical data is a promising tool for predicting the risk of ischemic stroke recurrence. RUSBoost emerged as the most reliable and generalisable model for clinical risk prediction, proved effective in improving prediction accuracy and identifying patients at highest risk. While SMOTE enhanced model learning during training. The findings highlight the importance of integrating AI technologies into clinical practice to support early treatment decisions and enhance preventive interventions, opening new pathways for better patient care and reducing the health burden from recurrent stroke.","65":"Headache is a common neurological disorder that reduces the quality of life of millions of people globally. It is usually treated on an outpatient basis, but in a few particular conditions, the patient needs hospitalization. Analyzing the headache profiles of headache-related hospitalizations can provide decision-makers with valuable information for better headache treatment. This prospective study aimed to analyze demographic information and clinical profiles of the patients hospitalized due to headache complaints at the Neurology ward of Sina Hospital between October 2022 and August 2024. Independent sample t-test and Welch's t-test were used to compare subgroups of patients, and the Mann-Kendall test was adopted to analyze the time series trend in admissions. Analyzing the data from 332 patients showed that the number of hospitalized patients increased monotonically during the study period. The patients diagnosed with secondary headaches were the largest group, followed by the patients with primary headaches and cranial neuropathies\/facial pains. In all these categories, the female-to-male ratio was greater than one. Chronic migraine and medication-overuse headaches were the most common diagnoses among the primary and secondary headaches, respectively. This study showed that women are more frequently hospitalized due to headaches than men. Most of the patients were diagnosed with secondary headaches due to the more challenging nature of this category.","66":"Sexuality and sexual health are essential for the overall well-being of all individuals. In neurology, research traditionally focused on disorders of sexual function associated with syndromes that present with specific lesions of the spinal cord and brain. In neuropsychiatric tic disorders, however, early research addressed sexuality and sexual behaviors in a wider context and beyond the strict diagnostic categories of sexual dysfunction, including gender identity and sexual orientation. Although these studies provided important insights in the behavioral structure of adults with primary tic disorders and Tourette syndrome, many of these early findings were not replicated subsequently and should, therefore, be critically reconsidered. This chapter provides a comprehensive catalog of existing data on sexuality and sexual health, including gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual dysfunction, adverse sexual experiences, compulsive sexual behaviors, and paraphilic disorders in adults with primary tic disorders. It also discusses the role of comorbidities, particularly attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, as well as the impact of neuropsychiatric medication. Additionally, it catalogs, for the first time, different therapeutic approaches that may improve sexual health in adults with primary tic disorders. Finally, knowledge gaps and methodological limitations are also addressed. Ultimately, this chapter's goal is to carefully present existing data, map underexplored needs, and highlight ways to respectfully address them both in clinical practice and through future research.","67":"After a year spent working for Jean-Martin Charcot, Georges Gilles de la Tourette published an article in 1885 that would become a seminal work, reporting on nine cases of tic disease. However, only four observations meet the current criteria of the eponym, including echolalia and coprolalia, the latter term coined by Gilles de la Tourette. In 1886, Charcot asked Georges Guinon to complete the clinical picture by adding obsessional disorders temporary control of tics, and the premonitory sensation leading to their occurrence. In 1888, Charcot presided over the jury for Gr\u00e9goire Breitman's thesis, then in 1890 for Jacques Catrou's thesis; both theses covered Gilles de la Tourette disease and were prepared with the namesake's help. Gilles de la Tourette put the finishing touch on the disease's description in 1900, which implicitly credited Guinon with completing the clinical picture and naming the disease at the time: \"la maladie des tics convulsifs\" (convulsive tic disease). That said, Gilles de la Tourette did not give much importance to his own nosographic contribution to neurology. After having been nearly forgotten, it was not until the 1960s that this pathology was definitively resurrected and validated by Arthur and Elaine Shapiro under the name of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. This was a testament to its significant prevalence and its treatment possibilities.","68":"Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is an X-linked recessive myopathy caused by pathogenic variants of the dystrophin-encoding DMD gene. The clinical presentation of BMD encompasses four clinical subtypes: limb-girdle muscle weakness, quadriceps myopathy, isolated cramp-pain syndrome, and asymptomatic hyper-creatine kinase-emia. Patients may also present with cardiopulmonary involvement, neuropsychological issues, joint contractures, and spinal deformities. Diagnosis primarily relies on genetic testing and\/or muscle biopsies. The treatment and management of BMD requires comprehensive and multidisciplinary interventions involving specialists in neurology, cardiology, respiratory medicine, rehabilitation medicine, orthopedics, gastroenterology, anesthesiology, clinical nutrition, psychology, and medical genetics. This coordinated approach aims to preserve patients' motor function, bone\/joint function, cardiopulmonary function, and digestive function, while maintaining a good nutritional status and psychological well-being. To standardize the diagnosis, treatment, and management of BMD in China, a joint committee comprising multidisciplinary experts from the Chinese Medical Association Rare Disease Branch and the Beijing Medical Association Rare Disease Branch was established. This committee formulated the Chinese expert consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of BMD, with the primary objectives of improving patient quality of life and reducing the disease burden.","69":"Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) is a severe subtype of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, characterized by early-onset, refractory seizures and associated with progressive psychomotor impairment, intellectual disability, and increased early mortality. In this cohort study, we evaluated patients diagnosed with 34 distinct EIEE subtypes over a 3-year period. In addition, we identified novel founder variants in unrelated patients from the Khorasan Razavi region in northeastern Iran. Clinical assessments were performed by specialists. All affected individuals experienced seizures with onset before one year of age. Global developmental delay and intellectual disability were diagnosed according to standard clinical criteria and evaluated by pediatric neurologists. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples for whole-exome sequencing, with candidate variants subsequently validated by Sanger sequencing. We identified a total of 61 genetic variants associated with 34 distinct EIEE subtypes in 65 unrelated families. Of these, 38 variants (62.3%) were novel, whereas 23 variants (37.7%) had been previously reported. Notably, recurrent founder variants were observed among patients originating from specific geographic regions. Overall, 44 variants (72.13%) were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, while 17 variants (27.87%) were categorized as variant of uncertain significance. This study highlights the substantial genetic heterogeneity of EIEE in an underrepresented region, the Khorasan Razavi Province, with a high proportion of novel and founder variants. This study underscores the limitations of gene panels and supports the use of comprehensive genomic techniques, such as whole-exome sequencing, for early and accurate diagnosis.","70":"Children with congenital anomalies (CAs) are at an increased risk of developing epilepsy, but the relative risk (RR) for specific anomaly subtypes remains underexplored. This study aims to estimate the risk of epilepsy, as indicated by antiseizure medication (ASM) prescriptions, among children with various CAs compared to children without anomalies. We utilized data from six European regions participating in the European network for surveillance of congenital anomalies registries, covering births from 2000 to 2015. Children with major CAs, classified by International Classification of Diseases codes, were compared to a reference population without anomalies. Epilepsy was identified based on >1 ASM prescription within a year. RRs were calculated using mixed-effects models to account for registry-specific variations. The study included 60,662 children with anomalies and 1,722,912 reference children, with a mean follow-up of 5.5 years. By age 5 years, ASM prevalence was 17.8 per 1000 in anomaly groups and 2.0 per 1000 in reference children. The highest RRs were observed in children with central nervous system anomalies, including anomalies of the corpus callosum, severe microcephaly, and hydrocephalus. Comparable RRs were found in children with severe congenital heart defects and gastrointestinal anomalies, primarily driven by diaphragmatic hernia. Children with CAs have a significantly higher risk of epilepsy, with central nervous system, chromosomal, severe congenital heart defect, and diaphragmatic hernia being key contributors. This study highlights the importance of tailored monitoring and early intervention for high-risk groups to improve neurological outcomes.","71":"This article reviews neurologic complications associated with pregnancy and menopause, the influence of pregnancy and menopause on preexisting neurologic disorders, and the management of neurologic disorders during pregnancy and menopause. Pregnancy and menopause can significantly impact neurologic health. Neurologic consultation regarding mode of delivery and anesthesia in patients with neurologic conditions is common, and very few neurologic conditions warrant cesarean delivery. Pregnancy is not a contraindication to acute ischemic stroke therapies or targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest. Both pregnancy complications and earlier age at menopause are associated with worse cognitive and cerebrovascular outcomes later in life. Hormone therapy is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, osteoporosis prevention, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause, all of which are conditions that may be exacerbated by underlying neurologic conditions or their treatments. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Women's Neurology curriculum provides core competencies guiding neurologic care through the lens of sex and gender across the lifespan. Neurologic care during pregnancy and menopause requires careful attention to the dynamic interplay between hormonal transitions, evolving evidence on diagnostic and treatment safety, and the lifelong neurologic risks associated with neurologic complications of pregnancy.","72":"No abstract available","73":"The history and evolution of neurologic education span from Hippocratic concepts of the brain as the center of thought to modern innovations in digital and arts-based learning. Nineteenth-century pioneers established neurology as a distinct discipline, and contemporary advances in neuroimaging, genetics, and telemedicine continue to reshape both what and how we teach. In today's fast-paced clinical environments, educators can still be effective at teaching by using learner-centered strategies such as prebriefing, microteaching, and structured feedback frameworks like the One-Minute Preceptor and the SNAPPS (summarize, narrow, analyze, probe, plan, select) model. These methods are central to integrating high-impact instruction into demanding settings of clinical care. In addition to traditional methods of teaching, emerging modalities, including simulation, blended learning, and intentional team-based methods, further enhance diagnostic reasoning and interprofessional collaboration. Technology-driven innovations such as teleneurology, virtual reality, and gamification expand access and engagement, whereas arts and humanities approaches foster observation, empathy, and reflective capacity. Together, these strategies illustrate that even amid clinical demands, neurologic education can remain central to the work. By intentionally planning for and integrating education into our clinical care, we are preparing the next generation of neurologists to think critically, act compassionately, and teach adaptively.","74":"Diagnostic labels in functional disorders are explored with particular reference to functional neurological disorder (FND). Use of the term 'functional' is discussed, and is compared with alternative terminology. Relevant considerations including avoidance of inaccurate nomenclature and dualist labels, and the impact of diagnostic label choice on individual patient experience and broader service provision are considered.","75":"Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an ENT emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment.\u00a0Most\u00a0cases are thought to be idiopathic, and early oral steroid initiation is thought to increase the likelihood of recovery. MRI\u00a0of the internal auditory meatus (IAM)\u00a0is the imaging modality of choice, as retrocochlear pathology needs to be excluded.\u00a0We report the case of a 54-year-old man who presented with left-sided sudden SNHL in the absence of any other symptoms. MRI IAM demonstrated inflammation in the posterior fossa (rhombencephalitis), prompting an urgent neurology referral. Lumbar puncture detected varicella zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis, and the patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir. He subsequently developed a vesicular rash weeks later. Follow-up MRI showed near-complete lesion resolution, and his hearing showed minor improvement. This case demonstrates how expedient MRI can detect unusual causes of sudden SNHL, enabling timely management and increasing the likelihood of resolution.","76":"A 34-year-old woman developed recurrent headaches with left-sided sensory and visual disturbances and was found to have multiple cystic brain lesions. This report documents the clinicopathological conference at the 45th Edinburgh Advanced Clinical Neurology course in 2025.","77":"A small proportion of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) presents as paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE). The most implicated antibody is anti-Hu, but others such as anti-ampiphysin, anti-CRMP5 and anti-SOX1 have been frequently detected. Autoimmune encephalitis mediated by antibodies against \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) is a rare but important neurological complication of SCLC. The incidence of SCLC presenting with anti-AMPAR antibody PLE is extremely low. Our case illustrates a rare presentation of SCLC with an intention to highlight the importance of evaluating for malignancy and associated paraneoplastic syndromes in patients with unexplained encephalopathy.","78":"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a diagnostic term that describes the neurodevelopmental and physical effects resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol. Individuals living with FASD can experience lifelong challenges, yet with a diagnosis and sufficient support for the individual and their wh\u0101nau (families), people can live fulfilling lives. Currently, little is known of the prevalence and impact in Aotearoa, New Zealand (NZ). Our aim is to identify the prevalence and understand the needs of young people living with FASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders in Youth Justice (YJ) residences in Aotearoa, NZ. One study will investigate the prevalence of FASD in this setting. The outcomes of both studies may demonstrate barriers and enablers, as well as strengths and gaps in YJ services of Aotearoa, NZ. The outcomes of both studies may guide reinforcing of current best practices as well as highlight necessary and novel initiatives together providing best support for the children and adolescents and their wh\u0101nau as well as staff across YJ residences. Extensive consultation with M\u0101ori and Pacific Advisory groups, researchers and experts in FASD and justice settings, individuals living with FASD and YJ staff together informed the development of this study.Children and adolescents (hereafter young people) aged 10 to 18 years and currently residing in YJ residences are eligible for participation and assessment for FASD through assenting and consenting to provide personal and social histories and completed physical and neuropsychological assessments. The comprehensive FASD histories, screening and assessment will be conducted by a neuropsychologist and paediatrician employing standardised assessment practices and instruments. The team will also collect information from health, education and care and protection records; from the young people themselves; and from their family and staff. The study will reference Whakakotahitanga, the newly released (2024) guidelines for screening and diagnosing FASD in Aotearoa, NZ while also acknowledging the differences imposed under constraints of funding research including, for example, time and money. An individualised report will be prepared for each young person and their wh\u0101nau. Study data will be analysed with descriptive statistics as appropriate. Our findings will be considered by the M\u0101ori and Pasifika advisory groups for framing and culturally secure translation, disseminated with all participating young people, translated to YJ services and staff, government and community neurodiversity sectors. Outcomes will be made available through community hubs, conferences, reports and peer-reviewed journal publications. The study has received ethical approval from the Southern Health and Disability Ethics Committee (2024 Full 20065). Locality ethical approval has been granted from Oranga Tamariki (Ministry of Children), and a privacy impact evaluation has been undertaken. The findings will be shared through peer-reviewed publication, local and national conferences and with key agencies including Oranga Tamariki.","79":"To determine whether neurorehabilitation can be enhanced through regional implementation of group-based telerehabilitation, we implemented the NeuroRehabilitation OnLine (NROL) innovation regionally and evaluated scale-up from a systems perspective. Observational, exploratory service evaluation using a mixed-methods convergent parallel design. Stroke and neurological rehabilitation services from four organisations across a regional healthcare system in the UK. Therapy staff from community-based services and patients with a stroke or neurological condition receiving active community rehabilitation including NROL from April 2022 to March 2024. A regional multidisciplinary group-based neurological telerehabilitation innovation (NROL). Selected Proctor's implementation outcomes, to establish system-level adoption, acceptability and sustainability of the regional NROL innovation. NROL was adopted by all intended organisations and continues as part of usual care with participation growing. It was acceptable to therapy staff and patients across the region, well-used, valued and supported increased therapy provision. For sustainability, staffing and travel efficiencies were identified through effective collaborative regional systems working. The importance of continued wide stakeholder engagement, robust evaluation and alignment was highlighted.

We launched a quality improvement initiative from April 1, 2024, to April 30, 2025, using the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control framework. Initial 6-month goals included: (1) administering antihypertensive treatment within 30 minutes of identifying ICH in \u226580% of patients with systolic blood pressure >150 mm Hg; (2) reversing anticoagulation within 45 minutes in \u226580% of anticoagulated patients; (3) performing repeat computed tomography head scans at 6 hours post-ICH identification in \u226580% of patients; and (4) initiating vascular neurology and neurosurgery assessments within 15 minutes of ICH recognition. Identified care gaps, informed by stakeholder feedback, led to the creation of a standardized Code ICH protocol and an emergency department-specific ICH electronic medical record power plan. Twenty patients were included in the 1-6-month interval (Code ICH activated in 15\/20 (75%) of eligible patients) and 12 patients in the 7-13 month interval (Code ICH activated in 8\/12 [67%]). Antihypertensive medication administration within 30 minutes occurred in 92% (11\/12) and 100% (3\/3) of patients with systolic blood pressure >150 mm Hg. Anticoagulation reversal within 45 minutes was achieved in all eligible patients (100%, 2\/2). Repeat computed tomography scans at 6 hours post-ICH identification were completed in 93% (11\/12) and 100% (8\/8) of patients at respective time points. Immediate vascular neurology evaluations were performed in all patients, and neurosurgery consultations occurred in 87% (20\/23). A sustainability plan was developed postintervention to maintain continued Code ICH activation and compliance. Implementation of a structured Code ICH protocol facilitated prompt neurological assessments and adherence with current national acute ICH management guidelines.","83":"Health equity research in neurology and neuroscience faces a unique challenge in the current United States climate of funding scarcity and prioritization of other research topics. The low funding contrasts with rising interest and scholarship in the field. Neuroscientists in the early phases of their career are particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of reduced funding due to their relatively lower publication history and established sources of support for projects. Here, we introduce the Early Career Network within the Society of Equity Neuroscience (SEQUINS). The group is dedicated to the support of early-career neurologists and neuroscientists who pursue health equity neuroscience research. We will accomplish this via a combination of virtual and in-person events as well as the establishment of a robust community of scientists. Together, we will foster camaraderie, solidarity, and shared interests to propel the field of health equity neuroscience forward.","84":"To determine the prevalence and trimester-specific trends of neuro-otological manifestations among pregnant women attending antenatal care in tertiary care hospitals at Karachi, Pakistan. A prospective, multicenter observational study was conducted from January 2020 to December 2024 at two tertiary hospitals in Karachi. A total of 1,230 pregnant women aged 18-45 years were enrolled through non-probability consecutive sampling. Data were collected using a validated three-part assessment tool encompassing demographic characteristics, otological symptoms, and neurological\/vestibular presentations. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were applied, with significance defined as <i>P<\/i> < 0.05. Neuro-otological symptoms were highly prevalent. Otological complaints were reported in 874 (71%) participants, most commonly tinnitus in 390 (31.7%) and ear fullness in 310 (25.2% ). Neurological and vestibular manifestations were observed in\u00a0847 (69%), with vertigo (304, 24.7%), headache (260, 21.1%), and dizziness (215, 17.5%) being the most frequent. A significant increase in the frequency of symptoms was noted with advancing gestational age, with the third trimester demonstrating the highest burden across most manifestations (<i>P<\/i> < 0.001). Neuro-otological manifestations are common during pregnancy and exhibit a trimester-dependent rise, peaking in late gestation. Routine screening and early recognition within antenatal care may help prevent misdiagnosis, reduce patient distress, and improve maternal quality of life.","85":"Lamotrigine is widely used in neurology and psychiatry, particularly in epilepsy and mood disorders, due to its favorable efficacy and safety profile. However, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and hormonal contraceptives have been increasingly recognized, raising concerns regarding therapeutic stability and reproductive safety in women of reproductive age. This narrative review examines the bidirectional interactions between lamotrigine and hormonal contraceptive methods, focusing on their pharmacokinetic mechanisms, clinical consequences, and implications for prescribing practice.\u00a0Relevant studies were identified and narratively synthesized to investigate the bidirectional interactions between lamotrigine and hormonal contraceptive methods, focusing on their pharmacokinetic mechanisms, clinical consequences, and implications for prescribing practice.\u00a0Available evidence consistently demonstrates that estrogen-containing contraceptives significantly reduce lamotrigine plasma concentrations through induction of hepatic glucuronidation, leading to substantial interindividual and intracycle variability. Cyclic contraceptive regimens further contribute to marked fluctuations in lamotrigine levels, with potential risks of subtherapeutic exposure during active hormone phases and toxicity during hormone-free intervals. In contrast, lamotrigine appears to exert minimal and clinically inconsistent effects on contraceptive efficacy, although hormonal fluctuations and breakthrough bleeding may occur. Progestin-only and non-hormonal contraceptive methods demonstrate more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and are associated with greater therapeutic stability. Although most data derive from epilepsy populations, these interactions are also relevant in psychiatric practice, where lamotrigine is commonly prescribed for mood stabilization and where modest pharmacokinetic shifts may have a significant clinical impact. An understanding of these interactions is essential to avoid misinterpretation of symptom recurrence, prevent adverse effects, and support informed contraceptive counseling. An individualized, multidisciplinary approach is recommended to optimize both psychopharmacological treatment and reproductive care.","86":"Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE), also known as steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT), is a rare autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndrome with highly variable clinical manifestations. Pediatric cases are particularly underrecognized, contributing to diagnostic delays. We describe a 13-year-old female patient who developed subacute behavioral changes, including withdrawal, emotional lability, and progressive manic and psychotic symptoms, over 1 month. Laboratory evaluation showed markedly elevated antithyroid antibodies with normal thyroid hormone levels, and thyroid ultrasound revealed features consistent with autoimmune thyroiditis. Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies were unremarkable. The patient demonstrated rapid and sustained improvement following pulse corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and low-dose antipsychotics. Her clinical course, combined with serological and imaging findings, supported the diagnosis of HE presenting with manic and psychotic features. This case emphasizes the importance of considering HE in the differential diagnosis of acute and subacute onset psychiatric symptoms in children and highlights the diagnostic utility of thyroid antibody testing in such presentations.

Eighty ALS patients were enrolled from the Department of Neurology at the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University between February 2023 and March 2024. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (CITF-based nursing interventions) or a control group (standard care). Over an 8-week period, the intervention group demonstrated significantly lower anxiety and depression scores, higher mental toughness, and improved sleep quality compared to the control group (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05). Additionally, the intervention group achieved higher ALSFRS-R scores (31.63\u2009\u00b1\u20093.54 vs. 29.58\u2009\u00b1\u20093.38) (<i>p<\/i> < 0.05). These findings indicate that CITF-based nursing interventions effectively reduce negative emotional states, enhance mental resilience, improve sleep quality, and boost overall quality of life in ALS patients. Based on this study, nurses can integrate CITF-based interventions into standard ALS care to enhance patients' emotional well-being and functional outcomes. <b>Trial Registration:<\/b> Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2500108691.","88":"Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is frequently associated with fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, while underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We report a 44-year-old male with persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection, including severe cognitive and motor fatigue, word-finding difficulties, and impaired concentration. Neuropsychological testing revealed marked deficits in alertness, attention, fluency, and processing speed. Serum analysis demonstrated anti-VGLUT2 autoantibodies. IVIG therapy yielded subjective but no objective improvement. This appears to be the first PCS case associated with\u00a0VGLUT2 autoantibodies and raises the hypothesis of a potential pathophysiological link that requires confirmation in larger cohorts.","89":"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder and one of the common causes of secondary hypertension. Patients with this condition often have characteristics such as reverse spoon-shaped blood pressure patterns and poor response to multiple drug treatments. Patients often attribute morning dizziness and fatigue to poor sleep quality, while neglecting the diagnosis and control of hypertension. Hypertensive encephalopathy (HE) is a hypertensive emergency, which may present with symptoms such as headache, vomiting, and epileptic-like seizures due to increased intracranial pressure. The impact of hypertension on sleep has not been reported in the literature. A 43-year-old male patient complained of having experienced elevated blood pressure for two years, and his blood pressure was poorly controlled without any monitoring. The patient had no family history of hypertension, and found that the blood pressure was not controlled after increasing blood pressure, and then came to the hospital for treatment due to the sudden increase of blood pressure, accompanied by dizziness and headache. During the hospitalization, the patients used various drugs with poor antihypertensive effect, and after examining the hypertension-related causes, it pointed to sleep dyspnea-related hypertension. During this period, the patient developed HE, sleep breathing disorder changed from obstructive to central, and tidal breathing appeared at the same time. After various non-invasive ventilator modes and pressure titration, the patient was treated and discharged from hospital. Patients with HE may experience complex types of sleep breathing disorders, which further lead to intermittent or persistent hypoxemia, making it difficult to control blood pressure and potentially damaging various organs throughout the body. During the period of providing respiratory support for such patients, it is necessary to pay attention to the supply of oxygen and the setting of ventilation modes for the current sleep breathing disorders. In cases where necessary, a multidisciplinary collaborative diagnosis involving sleep experts, respiratory experts, and neurology experts should be conducted.","90":"To explore the clinical and genetic features of a child with Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2B (PCH2B) due to compound heterozygous variants of the TSEN2 gene. A PCH2B patient presented at Department of Pediatric Neurology, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in June 2023 was selected as the study subject. Clinical data of the patient were retrospectively analyzed. The patient and her parents were subjected to whole exome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Pathogenicity of the candidate variants were classified based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). A literature review was also conducted by searching the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and PubMed databases from their establishment to May 2025 using keywords \"TSEN2 gene\" \"PCH2B\" and \"Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia 2B\" to summarize the clinical and genotypic features of patients with PCH2B due to variants of the TSEN2 gene. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Hospital (No.: #202310892). The patient, a 6-year-5-month-old girl, had exhibited severe global developmental delay, developmental regression, autism spectrum disorder, myoclonus of eyelids, feeding difficulty, irritability, progressive microcephaly, esotropia, and hypotonia. MRI showed reduced volume of bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. Genetic testing revealed that she has harbored compound heterozygous variants of the TSEN2 gene (NM_025265.4), namely c.1054A>T (p.Lys352*) and c.899G>T (p.Ser300Ile), which were inherited from her father and mother, respectively. Both variants were classified as likely pathogenic based on the ACMG guidelines and were previously unreported. Literature review has identified six PCH2B patients with missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants of the TSEN2 gene. Their main clinical manifestations included global developmental delay, progressive microcephaly, feeding difficulties, irritability, and vermis hypoplasia. Cranial MRI and genetic testing are crucial for definite diagnosis. The c.1054A>T (p.Lys352*) and c.899G>T (p.Ser300Ile) compound heterozygous variants of the TSEN2 gene probably underlay the pathogenesis in this patient. Above findings has expanded the genotypic and phenotypic spectra of TSEN2-related PCH2B, and offered guidance for genetic counseling for this family.","91":"The primary objectives of this study were to determine disparities in the supply, demand, and adequacy of the United States (US) neurologist workforce utilizing projections from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). This was an analysis of US-based neurologists leveraging data from the HRSA. Supply and demand were defined as the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) neurologists working and needed, respectively. Adequacy was defined as the ratio of supply over demand. Linear regression was used to analyze neurologist workforce trends from 2024 to 2037. From 2024 to 2037, the national supply of neurologists was projected to increase from 21,010 to 23,310 FTEs (10.9\u202f% increase, P\u202f<\u202f0.001). Over the study period, the demand for neurologists was also projected to increase from 23,720 to 25,560 FTEs (7.8\u202f% increase, P\u202f<\u202f0.001). Neurologist workforce adequacy was projected to increase from 2024 to 2037 (88.6\u202f% to 91.2\u202f%, P\u202f<\u202f0.001). By 2037, neurologist adequacy was projected to be lowest in the South (77.5\u202f%) and highest in the Northeast (129\u202f%) (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). Non-metropolitan areas were projected to have lower neurologist adequacy than metropolitan areas (21.4\u202f% vs 102\u202f%, P\u202f<\u202f0.001). In 2037, the states with the lowest projected neurologist workforce adequacy were Idaho (23.5\u202f%), Wyoming (25.0\u202f%), and Alaska (33.3\u202f%). In 2024, neurology ranked 29th out of 35 specialties for physician adequacy. As a specialty, neurology has among the least adequate physician workforces with deficiencies concentrated in non-metropolitan areas and certain identified states. While some future projected improvements were observed, additional strategies may be needed to enhance neurologist workforce adequacy in areas with identified deficiencies.","92":"Aging research seeks to understand the progressive decline in physiological function throughout adulthood. Frailty is a significant clinical manifestation of aging. Recent discoveries of global hallmarks of aging have paved the way for deeper insight into its molecular mechanisms. Proteomics has emerged as a powerful approach, given the proteome's sensitivity to environmental changes. This study aimed to uncover novel biological insights into aging by analyzing proteins that are significantly associated with chronological age or frailty. We conducted a systematic review of Medline and Embase up to August 2024 to find studies involving adults that used proteomic analyses. From each study, we compiled the significant proteins consistently reported across age-related or frailty-related studies by extracting statistical outcomes and expression patterns. Significant proteins were compared, and pathway enrichment analysis was performed using STRING software. Our analysis included 2,630 age-associated proteins from 27 studies and 194 frailty-associated proteins from 8 studies. We identified 177 shared proteins for both age and frailty, including nine with opposite expression trends. Meta-regression and pathway analyses revealed convergence on key biological processes, including immunity, inflammation, metabolism, homeostasis, coagulation, and neurology. These findings suggest that age- and frailty-related proteomic studies provide complementary insights into understanding the overall complexity of the biology of aging. This integrative approach emphasizes the potential of proteomics not only for biomarker discovery but also for advancing our understanding of our functional capacities. Future multi-omics studies will be essential for further elucidating the complex molecular landscape of aging.","93":"No abstract available","94":"Two-photon polymerization (2PP) has enabled three-dimensional printing at micro- and nanometer level resolution, allowing for the fabrication of patient-specific implants and finely structured cell scaffolds. This comprehensive review highlights recent advancements in integrating 2PP across various medical specialties, emphasizing its potential role in clinical and translational settings including ophthalmology, orthopedics, neurology, dermatology, and otolaryngology. Despite technological achievements, significant challenges hinder its widespread use, which are also discussed. This includes scaling of manufacturing processes, ensuring long-term biocompatibility of fabricated structures, and a lack of 2PP research in other medical fields. Advancements in biomaterials, photoinitiators, and integrated fabrication approaches within 2PP could significantly impact clinical practice and further improve patient outcomes.","95":"To honor the bicentenary of Jean-Martin Charcot's birth and to consolidate the primary materials from a historical exhibit on the topic at the 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Congress, this article aims to provide an overview of Charcot's place in the context of 21st century movement disorders neurology. Charcot (1825-1893) is largely considered the Father of Clinical Neurology, having established the basic discipline of anatomo-clinical correlations in brain and spinal cord disease. His contributions to movement disorders neurology were seminal and remain as anchors of 21st century neurological study. Original and secondary sources from international archives and collections served as the material for study and interpretation. Charcot fundamentally contributed to the clinical descriptions of Parkinson's disease, other parkinsonian syndromes, tremor conditions, tic disorders and chorea. Whereas he performed extensive neuroanatomical studies, he classified most movement disorders as n\u00e9vroses, conditions with undetected structural lesions yet to be defined. Charcot developed a clear classification system for movement disorders that largely remains intact today. He developed a French School of Neurology of both historical and modern fame, and, in introducing the model of an academic clinical hospital research center as multidimensional integration of clinical care, research, and education, he left a legacy that remains the model of the 21st century neurological research center.","96":"Emerging studies suggest increased febrile seizures during the Omicron period of SARS-CoV-2. This study compares the incidence of seizures before and during the Omicron variant period to determine if certain variants increase risk. Using PRISMA-P protocol, four databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched. Cohort studies reporting febrile seizures in children (up to 18\u00a0years of age) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. We provide descriptive summaries of the incidence of febrile seizures across hospital, emergency, and community settings, as well as a meta-analysis between Omicron-predominant and pre-Omicron periods. We included 36 studies comprising 82,591 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 2051 experienced febrile seizures. In 29 studies of hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2, the incidence of febrile seizures varied widely, with a median of 7 per 100 (range 1.06-25.54) children. High heterogeneity was observed, and studies from emergency and community settings were underpowered. Seven studies found that unvaccinated children hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 had more febrile seizures during the Omicron-predominant (median 11.8 per 100) than during the pre-Omicron period (median 0.7 per 100). The pooled incidence was 11.27 per 100 cases for the Omicron-predominant and 0.66 per 100 for the pre-Omicron period (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). There was a trend toward more reported febrile seizures among hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron-predominant than the pre-Omicron period. However, estimates are limited by small samples and moderate heterogeneity and should not be considered population-based incidences. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 variants may influence febrile seizure risk in children; larger studies are needed to better understand this association. PROSPERO registration: CRD420251054193. \u2022 Neurological complications, including febrile seizures, occur in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. \u2022 Prior to the Omicron variant, febrile seizures were relatively uncommon in pediatric COVID-19 cases. \u2022 There was a trend toward more reported febrile seizures among hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron-predominant period compared to the pre-Omicron period. \u2022 There are potential associations between SARS-CoV-2 variants and febrile seizure risks.","97":"This retrospective study aimed to precisely characterize the factors necessitating antiseizure medication (ASM) discontinuation in pediatric epilepsy patients and to delineate drug-specific adverse event patterns based on monotherapy and polytherapy regimens. We retrospectively analyzed data from patients under 18 years of age, followed at a single Pediatric Neurology Clinic between January 2015 and September 2024. Discontinuation was defined as the cessation of a medication due to inadequate efficacy or intolerable adverse effects. Patient demographics, epilepsy classification, ASM regimen, treatment duration, and detailed reasons for discontinuation were collected for analysis. Out of 4578 pediatric epilepsy patients screened, ASM discontinuation was recorded in 169 cases (4\u202f%). The discontinuation rate was higher in polytherapy (68\/1373, 5\u202f%) than in monotherapy (101\/3205, 3\u202f%). The most frequent compelling reasons for cessation were seizure persistence or worsening (48\/169, 28\u202f%) and psychiatric adverse effects (40\/169, 24\u202f%). Levetiracetam was overwhelmingly associated with psychiatric complaints (25\/34, 74\u202f%), while carbamazepine demonstrated a powerful correlation with the emergence of continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS) like sleep-activated epileptiform EEG pattern (28\/42, 67\u202f%), leading to its withdrawal. The mean time to discontinuation was 8\u202f\u00b1\u202f6 months. Our real-world data confirms that persistent seizures and drug-induced psychiatric adverse effects are the dominant causes of ASM discontinuation in children. The particular correlations between levetiracetam and psychiatric issues, and carbamazepine and CSWS-like sleep-activated EEG pattern, highlight the critical necessity for highly individualized ASM selection and close clinical and electroencephalographic monitoring in pediatric practice.","98":"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder cha- racterized by motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. However, it can also lead to non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairments and sarcopenia. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between screening and diagnostic methods for sarcopenia and temporal muscle thickness in Parkinson's disease patients, and to assess the utility of temporal muscle thickness measurement as an indicator of sarcopenia. An observational study was conducted with Parkinson's disease patients in a single neurology clinic. A total of 38 patients were included. Temporal muscle thickness was measured manually using brain computed tomography and muscle strength was assessed with handheld dynamometer. Malnutrition risk, sarcopenia risk and functional disease stage (Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr stage) were also evaluated in entire group. The mean temporal muscle thickness and handgrip strength were 6.12\u00b11.05 mm and 18.30\u00b15.55 kg respectively. Mean disease duration was 8.13\u00b13.11 years and the median H&Y stage was 2.21. There was a significant correlation between temporal muscle thickness and age (r=-0.326, p=0.046), SARC-F score (r=-0.738, p. Measurement of temporal muscle thickness using brain computed tomography in Parkinson' s disease patients may be a useful method for muscle mass determination and treatment of sarcopenia.","99":"Headache is a prevalent health concern among children and adolescents, affecting approximately 54.4% of this population. It has a negative impact on functionality and is associated with psychiatric conditions. The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence and comorbidity of headache among adolescents seeking care at a child psychiatry outpatient clinic and to compare the psychiatric conditions of adolescents with and without headache by using specific assessment scales. The study included a total of 306 patients (201 females, 105 males), comprising 108 adolescents with headache and 198 without headache, who were admitted to the Child&Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of a Mental and Nervous Diseas- es Training and Research Hospital. Patients presenting with complaints of headache were referred to the neurology department of the hospital for diagnosis and classification. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children - Present and Lifetime Version-Turkish Adaptation was administered to all participants. Additional self-report scales including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Forms 1 and 2, the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Young Internet Addiction Test\u00a0- Short Form were given. Parents filled out the Conners' Parent Rating Scale and the Turgay DSM-IV-Based Child and Adolescent Disruptive Behavior Disorders Screening and Rating Scale. Among participants, 35.3% (n=108) have reported headache, divided into two subgroups; 58 had migraine and 50 had tension-type headache. The prevalence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder as a comorbid diagnosis was found to be significantly higher in the migraine group compared to those without headache (p=0.009). Nevertheless, there was no difference between migraine and tension type headache groups in terms of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses (p>0,05). The participants in both headache groups exhibited significantly elevated scores on the CDI, STAI-1 and STAI-2 in comparison to those without headache (p < 0.001). A positive correlation was identified between headache severity and both depression and trait anxiety severity among participants with headache. When classified according to the course of headache, chronic migraine was associated with higher Turgay and Conners scores, while chronic tension-type headache showed significantly higher CDI, STAI-1, and STAI-2 scores compared to episodic forms (p = .003-.038). Psychiatric comorbidities are common in adolescents with headache, necessitating a comprehensive assessment that considers both conditions.
