The mechanisms driving resistance to anti-PD1 in SCCHN remain poorly understood. Using the IMMUcan multi-omics workflow, we characterized the molecular and immune profiles of R\/M SCCHN progressing on anti-PD1 treatment and compared them to an anti-PD1-na\u00efve cohort. Tumor biopsies from anti-PD1 resistant SCCHN patients exhibited significantly more EGFR and MYCL amplifications, along with increased MYC pathway alterations. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that anti-PD1 secondary resistant SCCHN had increased CD8+ T cell infiltration with higher levels of immune exhaustion markers than primary resistant and na\u00efve SCCHN. Additionally, high B2M expression correlated with greater T cell infiltration and improved survival following anti-PD1 therapy. Tumor cell B2M expression was independent of TMB and PD-L1 expression, suggesting that B2M expression could serve as an additional biomarker for anti-PD1 response.","1":"Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) are transforming the field of drug delivery, with one gene therapy product and four mRNA vaccines approved at the time of this report. As with other novel nanomedicines, the development of reliable and standardized methods for evaluating their quality attributes-factors that are essential for quality control and regulatory compliance-is essential to support their bench-to-bedside transition. Frit-Inlet Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (FI-AF4) combined with ultraviolet (UV), multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) online detectors is widely recognized as a robust and versatile technique for the physicochemical analysis of LNPs. A robust protocol for FI-AF4 method development was established for a mixture of MC3-LNPs and bovine serum albumin (BSA), guided by preliminary particle size and polydispersity assessments using lower-resolution techniques such as DLS and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The FI-AF4 technique was subsequently applied to characterize particle size and morphology, and to evaluate the most suitable MALS fitmodels across different analytical approaches. The coupling of FI-AF4 with online MALS and DLS enabled the simultaneous separation and online analysis of large sub-populations contained in the sample (methods 2-4), which could not be detected using method 1. The change in particle morphology was found to be significant amongst different methods for each subpopulation (shape factor 0.709-0.793 for LNP peak 1, 0.765-0.853 for LNP peak 2, and 1.069-1.263 for LNP peak 3). MALS fit models indicate that the coated sphere and random coil models were the most appropriate fits for the three LNP sub-populations (<i>R<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> > 0.95 and RMSE < 0.009). In summary, implementing the FI-AF4-UV-MALS-DLS protocol provided successful separation of LNPs from protein-containing media with additional analytical approaches not previously described by ISO guidelines. Collecting robust and reproducible information on LNP attributes is key to the several phases of drug development that ideally transform a drug in the pre-clinical phase, from bench-to-bedside.","2":"Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most severe manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is partially driven by type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Anifrolumab, an approved treatment for patients with SLE, has been investigated in a phase 2 trial in patients with LN receiving standard therapy (TULIP-LN, NCT02547922). We studied the impact of anifrolumab treatment on urinary biomarker expression in patients with LN through proteomic analysis of samples from TULIP-LN. Urine samples were collected at Weeks 0, 12, and 48, from patients treated with the anifrolumab basic regimen (BR; n=35), intensified regimen (IR; n=42), or placebo (n=35) in addition to standard therapy, and analyzed for the presence of 197 proteins. The impact of anifrolumab relative to placebo on prespecified biomarkers linked to histological activity was assessed, and a comparison of responders versus nonresponders was conducted on proteins detected in \u226575% of samples. Anifrolumab treatment significantly reduced urinary CD163 and MCP-1 expression at Week 12 versus placebo, including in patients classified as proteinuric nonresponders across all regimens. By Week 48, biomarker levels declined in all groups, indicating that standard therapy alone can eventually suppress intrarenal inflammation, but with slower kinetics. Proteomic analyses further revealed that anifrolumab was superior to placebo in reducing the proteomic inflammatory signature, regardless of responder status. Compared with placebo, anifrolumab treatment significantly reduced urinary biomarkers of renal histological activity in patients with LN, which may accelerate the resolution of intrarenal inflammation, potentially preventing damage accrual.","3":"To evaluate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) risk among new users of ertugliflozin versus sulfonylureas (SU) or thiazolidinediones (TZD) and incretin-based drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes. We used Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service adjudicated claims within the Innovation in Medical Evidence and Development Surveillance network to identify three new-user cohorts: (1) ertugliflozin; (2) SU\/TZD; and (3) incretin-based drugs. The outcome was a principal hospital discharge diagnosis for DKA. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated after 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching, separately for ertugliflozin vs. SU\/TZD and vs. incretin-based drugs. Subgroup analyses were performed based on baseline insulin use. After PS matching, baseline characteristics were similarly distributed in each cohort. For ertugliflozin (n\u2009=\u200942,907) vs. SU\/TZD (n\u2009=\u200942,907), the incidence rates of DKA per 1000 person-years (PY) were 2.95 and 1.49, respectively. For ertugliflozin (n\u2009=\u200942,247) vs. incretin-based drugs (n\u2009=\u200942,247), the incidence rates of DKA per 1000 PY were 2.76 and 1.06, respectively. For ertugliflozin vs. SU\/TZD, the HR [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 1.88 [1.17-3.02]; in non-insulin users, 2.34 [1.27-4.31]; and in insulin users, 1.17 [0.54-2.52]. For ertugliflozin vs. incretin-based drugs, the HR [95% CI] was 2.40 [1.40-4.11]; in non-insulin users, 2.84 [1.42-5.66]; and in insulin users, 1.87 [0.79-4.46]. Ertugliflozin was associated with a higher risk of DKA relative to comparators. HRs were higher among new users with no-concomitant insulin use than those with concomitant insulin use. Results were consistent with prior SGLT2i data and highlighted the importance of caution by both patients and physicians.","4":"Peptide-based therapeutics represent a rapidly expanding class of drugs. Endogenous peptides typically exhibit short elimination half-lives due to proteolytic cleavage and renal filtration. However, modifications such as amino acid substitutions and fatty-acid conjugation can significantly prolong their half-lives, enabling, for example, once weekly dosing. This study revisits the systemic pharmacokinetics of peptide drugs using classical pharmacokinetic principles and elucidates the scaling of peptide pharmacokinetics across species. Preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetic data were collected from published literature and AstraZeneca internal sources, covering four unconjugated peptides (teduglutide, apraglutide, pramlintide, and exenatide) and five fatty-acid conjugated peptides (tirzepatide, cotadutide, liraglutide, semaglutide and pemvidutide). Algebraic equations for clearance, volume of distribution, and plasma half-life were derived. Theoretical predictions from these models were broadly consistent with collected data; however, there was a tendency to overpredict the volume of distribution. Furthermore, for each peptide drug, these pharmacokinetic parameters were well described by inter-species allometric relationships. The allometric exponents for apparent clearance ranged from 0.58 to 0.88 (geometric mean: 0.72; n\u2009=\u20099; R<sup>2<\/sup>\u2009\u2265\u20090.93), while those for apparent volume of distribution ranged from 0.89 to 1.1 (geometric mean: 0.98; n\u2009=\u20098; R<sup>2<\/sup>\u2009\u2265\u20090.88). Notably, there were no differences in scaling exponents between unconjugated and fatty-acid conjugated peptides. In summary, our results underscore that the systemic pharmacokinetics of peptide drugs generally follow size-related physiological scaling patterns and provide quantitative tools to facilitate translational assessments in the drug discovery process.","5":"Subcutaneous (SC) administration is often a preferred approach for biologic therapeutics, offering enhanced convenience, improved patient adherence, and reduced healthcare costs compared to traditional intravenous (IV) infusion. The growing demand for high-dose subcutaneous formulations (HiSubQ), particularly for drugs requiring large doses, has driven advancements and innovations in formulation, manufacturing, device development, and analytical characterization. However, HiSubQ development faces challenges such as protein instability, high viscosity, and complex manufacturing processes. Addressing these hurdles requires innovative protein engineering, formulation strategies, advanced drug delivery devices, and high-resolution analytical tools to ensure stability, injectability, and bioperformance. A strong interdisciplinary collaboration across formulation, device, bioperformance, and analytics is required to drive such innovation. This review provides an overview of SC drug development, emphasizing key advancements in formulation design, biopharmaceutic considerations, device integration, and analytical characterization. We propose tactics and high-level roadmaps that can enable the development of patient-centric solutions to meet the rising demand for SC biologics.","6":"Approximately 15-30% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) present with metastases at diagnosis, while up to 50% will develop metastases during follow-up. The integration of targeted drugs into standard chemotherapy has significantly improved clinical outcomes, with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies playing a crucial role in the treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic CRC. In this context, high-quality RAS testing is essential. A national survey was carried out among 60 Italian laboratories to assess the state of the art for RAS testing. Based on the reported frequency of RAS mutations, laboratories were classified as \"in range\" (n. 35; RAS mutation frequency >42% and <56%) or \"outliers\" (n. 25; \u226442% or \u226556%). Considering the type of institutions, in Community Hospitals the percentage of 'outliers' is significantly higher than in Universities and National Cancer Institutes. Among the laboratories processing fewer than 150 samples per year, 'outliers' are more frequently detected in the group using Next generation sequencing (NGS) as prevalent methodology (n=10) than in the real time PCR (RT-PCR) group (n=4). In contrast, within laboratories processing more than 150 samples per year, the number of 'within range' laboratories (n=19) is more than twice that of 'outliers' (n=8) in the NGS group. The survey underscores the need for continuous training of stakeholders involved in molecular testing and a multidisciplinary approach to patient management. The authors suggest a similar evaluation in other European countries noting that beyond infrastructure and technology, personnel training and improved communication skills are essential for optimizing biomarker testing and personalized treatment approaches.","7":"The combination of doravirine and islatravir is under investigation as a fixed-dose, single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV-1. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of switching to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725 mg) from bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1. This phase 3, randomised, controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial was conducted at 49 research, community, and hospital-based clinics in six countries: Australia, Chile, Israel, Japan, the UK, and the USA. Adults aged 18 years or older with HIV-1, who were virologically suppressed (with a viral load of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) for at least 3 consecutive months on bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide and had no history of treatment failure or known resistance to doravirine, were eligible for the study. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule with a block size of three, to switch to oral doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725 mg) or to continue bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, once daily. Participants, investigators, study staff, and sponsor personnel were masked to study treatment; sponsor personnel directly involved in this analysis were unmasked at week 48. The primary endpoint, which was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment, was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach; non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95%\u2008CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05630755, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment. Between Feb 17 and Nov 17, 2023, 585 individuals were screened, of whom 514 were randomly assigned and 513 treated: 342 participants were switched to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725 mg) and 171 continued bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. The median age of the 513 participants was 47 years (IQR 37-58), 403 (79%) were assigned male and 110 (21%) were assigned female at birth, 158 (31%) were Black or African American, and 117 (23%) were Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. At week 48, doravirine and islatravir showed non-inferiority to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (viral load \u226550 copies per mL in five [1\u00b75%] of 342 vs one [0\u00b76%] of 171 participants) with a treatment difference of 0\u00b79% (multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI -1\u00b79 to 2\u00b79). The rates of adverse events (74\u00b76% [255 of 342 participants] vs 71\u00b73% [122 of 171 participants]; difference 3\u00b72 [95%\u2008CI -4\u00b77 to 11\u00b76]), treatment-related adverse events (10\u00b72% [35] vs 9\u00b74% [16]; 0\u00b79 [-5\u00b71 to 6\u00b70]), serious adverse events (4\u00b74% [15] vs 6\u00b74% [11]; -2\u00b70 [-7\u00b71 to 1\u00b79]), and discontinuations due to adverse events (2\u00b79% [ten] vs 1\u00b78% [three]; 1\u00b72 [-2\u00b73 to 3\u00b79]) were similar in the doravirine and islatravir group and the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group, and no deaths were reported. The combination of doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725 mg) has similar efficacy and safety profiles to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, and could provide a two-drug, once daily, oral single-tablet option without an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor for adults who are virologically suppressed and want to switch to a different ART regimen. Merck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck & Co.","8":"Doravirine and islatravir is an investigational, once-daily, single-tablet regimen containing two potent antiretrovirals with complementary mechanisms of action and resistance profiles. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching from stable, oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) to the fixed combination of doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725\u2008mg) in virologically suppressed adults living with HIV-1. This phase 3, randomised, active-controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial was conducted at 53 research, community, and hospital-based clinics in eight countries: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Adults (aged \u226518 years) with a viral load of fewer than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL on any oral, two-drug or three-drug ART regimen for at least 3 months, with no history of treatment failure, known resistance to doravirine, or active hepatitis B infection, were randomly assigned (2:1) according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule (block size three) to receive oral doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0\u00b725 mg) once daily or to continue baseline ART for 48 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by the anchor antiretroviral drug class (integrase strand-transfer inhibitor [INSTI], non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or protease inhibitor) in the baseline regimen. The primary endpoint (assessed in all treated participants) was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 (analysed according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach); non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95%\u2008CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The safety analysis population included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05631093, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment. Between Feb 20 and Oct 24, 2023, 614 individuals were screened for eligibility, of whom 553 were randomly assigned to receive doravirine and islatravir (n=368) or baseline ART (n=185). 551 participants received at least one dose of allocated medication: 366 in the doravirine and islatravir group and 185 in the baseline ART group. Of these 551 participants, 332 (60%) were assigned male and 219 (40%) were assigned female at birth, and the median age was 51 years (IQR 41-59); 250 (45%) identified as Black or African American and 80 (15%) identified as Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. Doravirine and islatravir showed non-inferiority at week 48, with viral loads of 50 copies per mL or higher in five (1\u00b74%) of 366 participants versus nine (4\u00b79%) of 185 participants on baseline ART (difference -3\u00b76% [multiplicity-adjusted 95%\u2008CI -7\u00b78 to -0\u00b78]). Treatment-related adverse events were more common with doravirine and islatravir (44 [12\u00b70%] of 366 participants) than with baseline ART (nine [4\u00b79%] of 185 participants; difference 7\u00b72 [95% CI 2\u00b72 to 11\u00b76]). Rates were similar in the doravirine and islatravir group and the baseline ART group for any adverse event (79\u00b75% [291 of 366 participants] vs 83\u00b78% [155 of 185 participants]; difference -4\u00b73 [-10\u00b77 to 2\u00b78]), serious adverse events (6\u00b73% [23] vs 4\u00b79% [nine]; 1\u00b74 [-3\u00b72 to 5\u00b72]), and discontinuation due to adverse events (0\u00b75% [two] vs 2\u00b72% [four]; -1\u00b76 [-4\u00b79 to 0\u00b72]). One death occurred (in the baseline ART group) and was not considered treatment-related. No participants discontinued treatment as a result of protocol-specified declines in CD4 cell or total lymphocyte counts. Doravirine and islatravir is efficacious and well tolerated and would represent the first non-INSTI-based, two-drug regimen for HIV-1 treatment. With increasing concern over the potential development of widespread INSTI resistance, this once-daily, oral, single-tablet regimen could be a potential option for people living with HIV-1 requiring a change to their antiretroviral regimen. The safety and efficacy findings support the ongoing development of islatravir, a drug with long-acting potential.

Herein, we describe the evaluation of an S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor, MSD-914, using mouse and nonhuman primate (NHP) models of lethal EBOV. Mice were completely protected from severe disease and death at doses as low as 0.31 mg\/kg\/day administered orally. From the pharmacological data and a toxicokinetic study, a predicted protective dose was selected for rhesus macaques (RMs). Surprisingly, orally administered MSD-914 was unable to protect RMs at doses as high as 0.8 mg\/kg\/day despite providing similar exposure of the drug to the efficacious dose observed in the mouse model.","10":"Alkyl-substituted <i>N<\/i>-hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters are valuable alternatives to alkyl halides in Ni-catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling reactions because they are typically more stable, can generate alkyl radicals under reductive conditions, and are readily prepared from carboxylic acids. However, the range of aryl halides that can be coupled with NHP esters in XEC has so far been largely limited to aryl iodides. Here, we describe a general method for coupling NHP esters bearing 1\u00b0, 2\u00b0, and strained ring 3\u00b0 alkyl groups with aryl bromides. This method is compatible with a broad range of substrates, including drug-like aryl bromides, and operates effectively in various non-amide based solvents. The use of a homogeneous organic reductant is crucial for achieving high yields, as it enables precise control over alkyl radical generation from the NHP ester.","11":"An understanding of how androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) prescribing patterns impact patient outcomes in a real-world setting is needed to help inform treatment decisions and improve the care of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). REASSURE was a retrospective, observational study that described patterns of ADT use derived from the electronic health records of 952 patients with PCa in the CancerLinQ database. Study objectives included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and ADT treatment duration by treatment received [goserelin or other ADTs (leuprorelin, degarelix, or triptorelin)]. While some patterns of ADT use in REASSURE were consistent with recommendations from clinical practice guidelines, there were also some inconsistencies. Findings from REASSURE highlighted the importance of considering potential differences in health care systems, population coverage, and patient data collection between regions, as well as incorporating data from multiple sources to capture data from more diverse patient populations, thus improving the quality of outputs from real-world studies.","12":"The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antibody-drug conjugates into the metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) treatment landscape has advanced therapeutic strategies beyond platinum-based chemotherapy (PBT). We evaluated real-world treatment patterns and overall survival (OS) among mUC patients during the period between maintenance avelumab (maintA) and enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab approvals in the United States. This retrospective cohort study utilized structured and chart review data from iKnowMed, a United States community oncology electronic health record database, to identify adult mUC patients initiating first-line (1L) anticancer treatment (index date) between April 2020 and September 2022. Patients were followed from the index date until March 2023, the last patient visit, or death, whichever occurred first. Descriptive statistics were used to report treatment patterns. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to assess OS. A total of 597 patients initiated 1L treatments (ICI monotherapy: 47.9%, PBT: 40.7%, other: 11.4%). The median age at diagnosis was 74 years, and 76.9% were male. Among patients receiving 1L PBT, 39.5% received maintA. Among those who were not on prior treatment at the end of the follow-up, 32.7% and 11.3% of 1L-treated patients received second-line and third-line treatment. The median OS from the index date for 1L-treated patients was 11.8 months (95% confidence interval 10.4-14.2 months). Despite the approval of maintenance therapy, prognoses for mUC patients remained poor. ICI monotherapy continues to be a common option in 1L. Many 1L patients did not have an opportunity to receive subsequent treatment, highlighting the continuing unmet need for mUC patients.","13":"Neoantigen-based adoptive T cell therapies (ACTs) represent a promising avenue in cancer immunotherapy due to their exquisite tumor specificity. The first cell-based immunotherapy for a solid tumor, comprising tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, recently received FDA approval. Building on this, we designed a distinct ACT approach, where T cell responses against personalized neoantigens are systematically generated from autologous peripheral blood. Here we report the establishment of NEO-STIM, an ex vivo induction process to prime and expand pre-existing memory and de novo CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses, thereby highlighting critical parameters for generating potent neoantigen-specific T cell responses. The drug products comprise mutant-reactive, polyfunctional, and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, able to recognize autologous tumor material. Following infusion, T cell responses are detected in tumor and blood of a patient, and display activated\/exhausted and cytotoxic phenotypes. A first-in-human clinical trial (NCT04625205) recently further validated proof-of-concept, supporting continued development of this ACT approach.","14":"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone widely used to manage diabetes and obesity, through its ability to regulate glucose homeostasis. Clinically relevant GLP-1 sequences form oligomeric states. Uncontrolled oligomer formation can drive fibril formation, posing challenges such as difficulty in controlling drug dosage, loss of activity, or toxicity, as the aggregates can be immunogenic and\/or can form amyloids. Here, we used combined measurements of colloidal and conformational stability to characterise the intermolecular interactions underpinning the physical status of the GLP-1 7-37 amide (GLP-1am), at pharmaceutically relevant high concentrations. We focus on less explored conditions, around pH 5, mimicking the environment within native cellular secretory granules, where the hormone is also densely packed. Co-solutes allowed us to interfere with weak interactions affecting peptide self-association into soluble oligomers, and the conversion into aggregates and fibrils. We show that GLP-1am exists as soluble oligomers that assemble into nanosheets over the timescale of hours, in quiescent conditions. Aggregation proceeded via a nucleation-dependent mechanism, with its rate correlating to the magnitude of attractive intermolecular interactions. It was accelerated by ionic co-solutes, indicating a key role for screening of electrostatic interactions in modulating peptide-peptide attraction and assembly. The rate of aggregation was also pH-dependent, with rates being slower at pH 5 than pH 8. Notably, the addition of proline, as a co-solute, delayed the onset of GLP-1am aggregation in a pH-dependent manner. Thus, in quiescent conditions, GLP-1am forms discrete soluble oligomers capable of organising into ordered nanostructures rather than amyloid fibrils.","15":"Digital twins can revolutionize drug development and personalized care by accelerating timelines, reducing costs and failure rates, and potentially improving the safety and efficacy of new therapies. In this review, we explore different applications of digital twins across the pharmaceutical value chain, from target discovery and preclinical research to clinical trials, regulatory review, manufacturing and post-market clinical practice. Key challenges, however, remain in data integration, model reliability, regulatory acceptance and data privacy. Overcoming these barriers will require innovation, transparency and collaborative efforts across the healthcare ecosystem to fully realize digital twin potential for patients, healthcare providers and the pharmaceutical industry.","16":"Covariate selection in population pharmacokinetics modeling is essential for understanding interindividual variability in drug response and optimizing dosing. Traditional stepwise covariate modeling is often time-consuming, compared to the new machine learning alternatives. This study investigates the use of neural networks with stochastic gates for automated covariate selection, aiming to efficiently identify relevant covariates while penalizing excessive covariate inclusion. On various synthetic datasets, the approach demonstrated robustness in detecting important covariates, overcoming challenges such as high correlations, low covariate frequencies, high interindividual variability, and complex covariate dependencies. In real clinical data from a monalizumab study, the method successfully identified covariates that matched those found by experts. However, for tixagevimab\/cilgavimab, it identified a superset of covariates, indicating a potential need for further pruning. This machine learning-based method enhances the covariate preselection process in population pharmacokinetics model development, offering significant time savings and improving efficiency even under challenging scenarios.","17":"Biomarker testing is essential for guiding first-line treatment decisions in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC). Despite guideline recommendations, real-world testing patterns remain variable and may contribute to disparities in outcomes. This study examined real-world biomarker testing patterns and their associations with first-line treatment selection, clinical characteristics, and sociodemographic factors in patients with newly diagnosed mNSCLC. Using the Healthcare Integrated Research Database, we identified adults diagnosed with mNSCLC between January 2019 and July 2022 with continuous health plan enrollment. Patients were categorized by the type of biomarker testing they received within 90 days of diagnosis; eligible patients had: (1) no biomarker testing, (2) immunohistochemistry (IHC) only, (3) testing of fewer than 5 genes (<5GT) plus IHC, or (4) testing of at least 5 genes (\u22655GT) plus IHC. Multivariable analyses assessed associations between testing, treatment patterns, and social determinants of health. Among 5611 eligible patients, 7.8% had no biomarker testing, 54.0% had IHC only, 13.2% had <5GT plus IHC, and 25.0% had \u22655GT plus IHC. Overall, 61.8% of patients did not receive guideline-concordant testing. More comprehensive biomarker testing was associated with a higher likelihood of receiving targeted therapy or immunotherapy and a lower use of chemotherapy alone. Testing and treatment patterns varied significantly by socioeconomic status, race\/ethnicity, insurance type, and geographic region. Patients in higher socioeconomic quartiles, with commercial insurance, or residing in the western US were more likely to receive targeted therapies. Most patients with mNSCLC did not undergo comprehensive biomarker testing, leading to potential missed opportunities for precision therapy. Disparities in testing and treatment underscore the need for expanded access to molecular diagnostics, payer support for comprehensive testing (including liquid biopsy), and alignment with national guidelines to improve outcomes and advance equitable cancer care.","18":"Romania's healthcare system struggles with the EU's highest rates of treatable and preventable mortality and the lowest per capita health expenditure. Critical issues include unsustainable financing, an entrenched physician-centered model lacking institutional accountability, delayed digitalization, and inadequate clinical research capacity, necessitating structural and paradigmatic shifts. The objective of this study was to synthesize multi-stakeholder consensus recommendations for comprehensive reform of the Romanian healthcare system, focusing on financing, service delivery, and human resources. This manuscript details recommendations from a multi-stakeholder consensus conference organized in April 2025 by the Aspen Institute Romania. Participants addressed topics including financing, patient-centered hospital models, clinical research, health innovation, and the European Health Data Space (EHDS). Consensus recommendations include: stabilizing national health insurance funds (broadened contributions, multi-year budgets); shifting hospitals to patient-centered, institutionally accountable models (transparent allocation, digital integration, eradicating informal payments); equitable hospital reimbursement (unified tariffs); accelerated digital transformation (EHDS alignment, national Electronic Health Record); enhanced clinical trial capacity (personnel, infrastructure, regulatory efficiency); and exploring regulated dual practice, contingent on successful prior reforms. Key challenges include transforming hospital culture, promoting digital adoption, and navigating the complexities of politics and finance. These interconnected recommendations form a roadmap for transformative reform, crucial given the untenable status quo. Success requires sustained political will, stakeholder collaboration, investment, and robust governance to create a financially stable, patient-centered, equitable, and innovative system.","19":"Platinum-based chemotherapy is commonly used for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) treatments, yet clinical outcomes remain poor. Cellular senescence and its associated secretory phenotype (SASP) can have multiple tumor-promoting activities, but both are largely unexplored in these cancers. In this study, using xenograft, orthotopic and Kras<sup>G12V<\/sup>-driven murine NSCLC models, we demonstrate that cisplatin-induced senescence strongly promotes malignant phenotypes and tumor progression, which is stimulated by aging. Mechanistically, we found that a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2)-enriched SASP drives pro-proliferative effects through TGFBR1 and AKT\/mTOR. TGFBR1 inhibition with galunisertib or senolytic treatment reduces tumor progression driven by cisplatin-induced senescence, and concomitant use of TGFBR1 inhibitors with platinum-based chemotherapy reduces tumor burden and improves survival. Finally, we validate the translational relevance of tumor-promoting TGF\u03b2-enriched SASP using clinical NSCLC and HGSOC samples from patients who received neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Together, our findings identify a potential cancer therapy resistance mechanism and provide preclinical proof of concept for future trials.","20":"Therapeutic epigenetic modulation is currently being evaluated in the clinic to sensitize homologous recombination (HR)-proficient tumors to PARP inhibitors. To broaden its clinical applicability and identify more effective combination strategies, we conducted a drug screen combining PARP inhibitors with 74 well-characterized epigenetic modulators targeting five major classes of epigenetic enzymes. Notably, both type I PRMT inhibitors and PRMT5 inhibitors scored highly in combination efficacy and clinical prioritization. PRMT inhibition significantly enhanced PARP inhibitor-induced DNA damage in human HR-proficient ovarian and breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, PRMT suppression downregulates DNA damage repair genes and BRCAness-associated pathways, while also modulating intrinsic innate immune responses within cancer cells. Integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and functional datasets from TCGA and DepMap further supports PRMT1, PRMT4, and PRMT5 as promising therapeutic targets in oncology. Importantly, dual inhibition of PRMT1 and PRMT5 synergistically sensitizes tumors to PARP inhibitors. Collectively, our findings provide strong rationale for the clinical development of PRMT and PARP inhibitor combinations in HR-proficient ovarian and breast cancers.","21":"Immunogenicity assessments are critical for evaluating biological therapeutics. Preexisting immune reactivity can affect clinical safety and efficacy and confound anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay cut point determination, complicating identification of treatment-emergent ADA. In the ALXN-X program, approximately 50% of na\u00efve human serum samples showed preexisting reactivity, with some signals exceeding background by more than 100-fold, challenging ADA method development (cut points, sensitivity, drug tolerance). Competitive inhibition experiments were conducted to map the binding site of the preexisting reactivity and depletion with protein A\/G agarose was performed to further characterize the preexisting reactivity. A modified ADA assay with an engineered drug molecule was developed to mitigate its impact on assay performance. This preexisting reactivity binds to the C-terminal conserved framework sequence of the drug molecule. Characterization indicated that the preexisting reactivity is likely attributable to immunoglobulins. The modified ADA assay can effectively mitigate the impact of the preexisting reactivity on the assay performance, while maintaining the ability to detect ADA response specific to the unique epitopes of ALXN-X. Preexisting, immunoglobulin-mediated reactivity targeting ALXN-X's Cterminal framework sequence complicates ADA assay performance. A modified ADA assay mitigates this interference while preserving detection of ALXN-X-specific ADA, supporting more reliable immunogenicity assessment.","22":"The therapeutic landscape has diversified beyond traditional small molecules to encompass a plethora of different modalities including antibodies, peptides and nucleic acids as well as more complex small molecules. Increasingly heterofunctional molecules, targeted drug conjugates, including antibody drug conjugates, oligonucleotide drug conjugates and radionuclide conjugates, are being used to improve efficacy, reduce side effects and enable lower doses. These diverse modalities present distinct delivery needs. This perspective briefly reflects on the main drug modality classes, their delivery challenges and summarises the current delivery solutions and trends including amorphous solid dispersions, long acting injectables, approaches to high concentration subcutaneous delivery of biologics and lipid nanoparticles for delivery of mRNA. There is a continual drive for more patient centric formulations. We argue that this modality evolution heightens the importance of drug delivery as a core design parameter in discovery rather than as a downstream fix. Across modalities, targeted delivery remains pivotal to improve therapeutic index and to lower dose and environmental footprint. Translational success requires early collaboration among preclinical safety, CMC, clinical, and regulatory teams to define critical quality attributes and develop in vitro\/in silico tools for predicting in vivo performance. Delivery science is positioned to play a leading role in enabling the next generation of medicines, accelerating translation, and improving patient outcomes.","23":"Heart failure (HF), including heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), remains a major public health issue with increasing disease burden. Recent advances, particularly data on sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), have shifted HFrEF treatment paradigms based on strong evidence from randomised-controlled trials (RCTs). There is a lack of data reflecting HFrEF patient outcomes in relation to SGLT2i treatment in a real-world environment. The ongoing H<sup>2<\/sup>-registry, initiated in 2021, collects real-world data on hospitalised HF patients in Germany. We analysed HFrEF patients (left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF\u2009\u2264\u200940%) enrolled until 30-11-2024, stratified by SGLT2i treatment status at index hospital discharge and during follow-up (FU). We assessed baseline characteristics, predictors of SGLT2i use, and 12-month outcomes. Of 810 HFrEF patients (513 SGLT2i, 297 no-SGLT2i), the median age was 70 years, and 23% were female. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. Median LVEF was 30%, and 39% had type 2 diabetes. Use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) was more common in the SGLT2i group. Patients treated with SGLT2i at baseline had significantly lower all-cause mortality during FU in unadjusted time-to-event analyses (HR [95% CI] 0.53 [0.33-0.88]; p\u2009=\u20090.012). However, in multivariate analyses, only MRA treatment was independently associated with reduced mortality risk during FU (HR [95% CI] 0.41 [0.23-0.74]; p\u2009=\u20090.003). In a sub-cohort of patients being continuously treated with an SGLT2i during FU, the observed effect of SGLT2i was more pronounced (unadjusted HR [95% CI] 0.46 [0.28-0.77], p\u2009=\u20090.0023), and continuous SGLT2i treatment was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality in multivariate analyses (adjusted HR [95% CI] 0.54 [0.30-0.99], p\u2009=\u20090.046). In this prospective German HF registry, SGLT2i treatment was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality in HFrEF patients only with continuous use during FU. Treatment with MRA was independently associated with lower all-cause mortality in all performed analyses. These findings add to the available body of evidence regarding the real-world effectiveness of SGLT2i in HFrEF.

NAs display a broad range of carcinogenic potential, from high carcinogenic potency to being weak or even non-carcinogenic. In vitro Ames tests, conducted with both rat and hamster liver-induced S9, and in vivo transgenic rodent (TGR) mutation assays have been used by pharmaceutical sponsors for hazard identification of NDSRIs. A comparative analysis of Ames tests and TGR results for 33 NDSRIs was performed and revealed an accuracy of 79% between the overall mutagenic calls in the two assays. For NDSRIs with positive TGR results, mutagenic potency estimates were calculated and compared to NAs with robust carcinogenicity and TGR dose-response data. Results from these NAs demonstrated a strong correlation between carcinogenic potency (TD<sub>50<\/sub>) and TGR mutagenic potency (BMDL<sub>50<\/sub>) (r<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.95), which supports the use of TGR data for both hazard identification and acceptable intake (AI) determination. By integrating quantitative risk assessment tools with TGR assays, this work contributes to a more robust framework for evaluating NA-associated risks.","25":"Sotatercept is a first-in-class activin signaling inhibitor, developed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This open-label single-arm, multicenter, phase 3 study was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sotatercept in Japanese participants with PAH. Forty-six adult Japanese participants with PAH on stable background therapy were enrolled and received subcutaneous sotatercept starting at 0.3 mg\/kg with a target dose of 0.7 mg\/kg administered every 3 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance at 24 weeks. Of 46 participants, 29 (63%) were WHO functional class II and 17 (37%) were class III. At 24 weeks, pulmonary vascular resistance decreased 99.2 (95% CI: -129.6 to -68.4) dynes\u2217sec\/cm<sup>5<\/sup> and, 6-minute walk distance (key secondary endpoint) increased 41.8 (95% CI: 27.8-55.5) meters. There were 6 (13%) serious adverse events (AEs) and no discontinuations due to AEs in the primary period. Safety was consistent with the known safety profile for sotatercept with AEs that were clinically manageable. In this study of Japanese participants with PAH, improvements in pulmonary vascular resistance and 6-minute walk distance were observed, consistent with the pivotal phase 3 STELLAR (A Study of Sotatercept for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension [MK-7692-003\/A011-11]) trial. These data suggest that sotatercept may be an important treatment option for Japanese patients with PAH. (A Study of Sotatercept in Japanese Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension [PAH] Participants [MK-7962-020], NCT05818137; Japan Registry of Clinical Trials [jRCT2031230046]).","26":"Non-sterile drug products represent approximately 30% of annual drug sales. Non-sterile drug products offer therapeutic advantages, manufacturing costs which permit wide patient access, versatility of dosage form and routes of administration which facilitate patient compliance. These advantages have resulted in an increase in the number and nature of non-sterile finished dosage forms. Regulations and standards require the provision of non-sterile drugs to controlled levels of bioburden, the absence of specified microorganisms and the absence of objectionable microorganisms. Thoroughly understanding the microbiological risks and control performance in non-sterile manufacturing is vitally important in the improvement in the quality and compliance of non-sterile manufacturing. Prior publications have reported the magnitude and characteristics for non-sterile product recalls and regulatory compliance shortfalls from 2004 to 2011 and from 2012 to 2019. The purpose of this review is to similarly provide a valuable contemporary update of the microbiologically related quality and compliance issues specifically associated with non-sterile drug products by reviewing drug recalls and Form FDA 483s. This includes evaluation of incidences of microbiological quality and regulatory compliance issues through more detailed abundance analysis. This data and information should assist in the risk assessment and risk management necessary in the manufacture of non-sterile products and beneficial to the pharmaceutical microbiologist.","27":"Molecular structure prediction is essential for understanding therapeutic functions and accelerating pharmaceutical research. While state-of-the-art deep learning models like AlphaFold demonstrate strong performance on general protein backbone prediction, they struggle with critical regions of VHH antibodies, a novel family of molecules underrepresented in current training datasets. Many academic and industry laboratories can generate high-quality VHH structures for novel sequences, presenting an opportunity to improve model performance through iterative fine-tuning with strategically selected new data. However, experimental structure determination requires weeks to months of effort and significant costs per structure, making exhaustive data collection impractical. Randomly curating subset of full collection yields suboptimal improvements, as many structures provide redundant information while key regions remain unexplored. Strategic data selection can identify which structures, once experimentally determined, will maximally improve prediction accuracy, enabling superior model performance with fewer iterations and lower costs. We propose DEWDROP, an active learning selection method that guides VHH structure curation to maximally improve fine-tuned model performance. DEWDROP leverages Monte Carlo dropout to generate prediction ensembles that inform optimal data selection. While we focus on VHH antibodies, underrepresentation issues affect many molecular domains, making DEWDROP broadly applicable as a model-agnostic method for structural biology applications. To demonstrate this effectiveness, we evaluate our approach through retrospective iterative fine-tuning experiments and batch selection analysis on two distinct structural families: VHH antibodies from SAbDab-nano as our target application and primary benchmark and <i>Mycobacterium leprae<\/i> proteins from the AlphaFold Protein Database to demonstrate broader applicability across different molecular domains. For all analyses, we use a structured prediction model based on coarse-grain molecular representations that operates independently of multiple sequence alignments called Equifold. We demonstrate that DEWDROP (1) improves model training efficiency through optimized batch selection, outperforming baseline methods and (2) selects structurally informative data with high information content.","28":"Improving care of patients with hyperlipidemia requires an understanding of the barriers physicians perceive in prescribing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapies. This study explores physicians' perceptions of time and resource burdens, identify perceived patient adherence barriers, and examine factors influencing physicians' decision-making in LDL-C management. This is a non-interventional, cross-sectional, online survey of US-based primary care practitioners (PCP) and cardiologists who recommended or provided lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) to \u226550 adults per month, practiced for \u22652 years, and completed the survey in English. The survey comprised multiple-choice, constant sum, and numerical questions about physician decision-making, patient management, and perceptions of patient attitudes\/behaviors regarding LDL-C management. Descriptive univariate analyses were conducted. 200 PCPs and 200 cardiologists completed the survey. Most physicians reported prescribing lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) and that patients declined injectable proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i). They attributed this refusal to cost\/insurance, fear\/discomfort taking injections, and a preference for oral therapies. Physicians viewed patients with a history of ASCVD, with LLT experience, and those with greater understanding of ASCVD risk to have higher LLT adherence compared to those without. Most physicians spent a median of 10 min in shared decision-making conversations, regardless of therapies they prescribed. They reported needing longer to instruct patients during adherence counseling for PCSK9is than for oral therapies. Our findings suggest patient, clinician, and system barriers may all hinder LDL-C management and adherence. A greater understanding of the association between perceived barriers and real-world behaviors will help optimize lipid management.","29":"Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Herein, we describe the discovery and optimization of a novel series of AR PROTACs capable of degrading AR and important resistance mutations such as L702H AR. A novel AR-binding cyanoindole motif was identified from a directed screen of the AstraZeneca collection. This was optimized and elaborated to identify a suitable exit vector from which to form an initial PROTAC capable of degrading AR. The series was further optimized in terms of potency and rodent oral bioavailability with an isomeric switch of the piperidine substitution, removing an <i>in vitro<\/i> mitotoxicity signal to give <b>3n<\/b>. This compound inhibited AR signaling <i>in vitro<\/i> and was able to inhibit tumor growth <i>in vivo<\/i> in a mouse prostate cancer xenograft model. Extensive profiling in terms of drug-like properties allowed this to be progressed into development as AZD9750.","30":"In tumors, reciprocal spatial interactions between immune cells, their mediators, the extracellular matrix, and mutated neoplastic cells impact all aspects of treatment resistance. The operational mechanisms of these interactions are foundational for developing insights and targets for cancer therapy and prevention. Spatial quantification of the tumor microenvironment system from image data has untapped potential for patient stratification. Here, we present SparTile, a powerful computational approach for the analysis of multiplex proteomics images to reveal clinically relevant structural organization in the tumor microenvironment. SparTile enables robust and unbiased identification and characterization of tumor microenvironments based on spatial relationships among protein markers without the need for cell segmentation or classification. Applied to tissues of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer, SparTile identifies repeatable microenvironments with specific cellular relationships. Several microenvironments are characterized by risk markers such as Ki67+ (p-value\u2009=\u20090.052) and vimentin+ (p-value\u2009<\u20090.01) tumor cells, which correlate with poor survival. Furthermore, myeloid markers in an MX1-positive tumor environment correlate with shorter survival (p-value\u2009=\u20090.04). Finally, the relative distance between tumor and myeloid cell markers is a strong prognostic risk factor in multivariate Cox models (p-value\u2009<\u20090.01). This distance metric is externally validated on two datasets of breast cancer multiplex images (p-values\u2009<\u20090.01). Our results show that unbiased protein-based and segmentation-free spatial analysis is effective for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers from multiplex tumor images and identifying predictive biology.","31":"The 19<sup>th<\/sup> Workshop on Recent Issues in Bioanalysis (19<sup>th<\/sup> WRIB) took place in New Orleans, LA, USA on April 7-11, 2025. Over 1200 professionals representing pharma\/biotech companies, CROs, and multiple regulatory agencies convened to actively discuss the most current topics of interest in bioanalysis. The 19<sup>th<\/sup> WRIB included 3 Main Workshops and 7 Specialized Workshops that together spanned 1\u00a0week to allow an exhaustive and thorough coverage of all major issues in bioanalysis of biomarkers, immunogenicity, gene therapy, cell therapy and vaccines.Moreover, in-depth workshops on \"Implementation Practice for the Newest ELN\/LIMS Systems\" and on \"Vaccine Cell-Based\/Functional & Molecular Assays as part of the harmonization of vaccine clinical assays global initiative\" were the special features of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> edition.As in previous years, WRIB continued to gather a wide diversity of international, industry opinion leaders and Regulatory Agency experts working on both small and large molecules as well as gene, cell therapies and vaccines to facilitate sharing and discussions focused on improving quality, increasing regulatory compliance, and achieving scientific excellence on bioanalytical issues.This 2025 White Paper encompasses recommendations emerging from the extensive discussions held during the workshop and is aimed to provide the bioanalytical community with key information and practical solutions on topics and issues addressed, in an effort to enable advances in scientific excellence, improved quality and better regulatory compliance. Due to its length, the 2025 edition of this comprehensive White Paper has been divided into three parts for editorial reasons.This publication (Part 2) covers in the Part 2A the recommendations on Biomarkers\/BAV, IVD\/CDx, Ligand-Binding Assays and Cell-Based Assays and in Part 3B the Regulatory Inputs on these topics. Part 1 (Mass Spectrometry Assays and Regulated Bioanalysis\/BMV) and Part 3 (Gene Therapy, Cell therapy, Vaccines and Biotherapeutics Immunogenicity) are published in volume 18 of Bioanalysis, issues 3 and 1 (2026), respectively.","32":"Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare inherited metabolic disease caused by mutations in the <i>ALPL<\/i> gene. The disease is heterogeneous, complicating its diagnosis and delaying optimal management, leading to severe or lethal outcomes such as failure to thrive, fragility fractures, bone deformities, delayed motor development, respiratory failure, seizures, and premature death. However, no epidemiological studies on the incidence of HPP in Saudi Arabia have been identified until now. Therefore, the study aimed to describe the phenotype and genotype of Saudi patients with HPP. This retrospective multicenter case series included six centers in Saudi Arabia. Paediatrics and adult patients with clinically and genetically confirmed HPP were included between January 2014 and May 2024. Demographic and clinical information, including medical history, clinical, biochemical, genetic, and management data, was collected retrospectively from medical records and summarized descriptively. Additionally, whole-exome sequencing or ALPL next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed. Furthermore, pre- and post-analysis for patients who received asfotase alfa was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The study included 19 HPP cases, of whom 68.4% were male. There were five patients with perinatal onset (26.3%), 13 with infantile onset (68.4%), and one with childhood onset (5.3%) of HPP. About 78.9% of patients indicated a family history of HPP; consanguinity was observed in nearly all parents of cases. Bone deformities were observed in all patients, including skull (78.5%), limb (100%), spinal (49.9%), and dental abnormalities (57.9%). Complications such as craniosynostosis (78.5%), nephrocalcinosis (26.3%), kyphoscoliosis (49.9%), and convulsions (26.3%) were also documented, with 4 (21.05%) deaths. Thirteen (68.4%) of our patients received asfotase alfa. All cases tested positive for <i>ALPL<\/i> variants, with the most common being c.293C>T (p.Ser98Phe) and c.977G>T (p.Gly326Val), both of which were novel and not previously reported. Our study highlights HPP's diverse phenotypes and genotypes in Saudi Arabia, revealing distinct <i>ALPL<\/i> mutations. We identified a high prevalence of consanguinity and family histories of HPP. Treatment with asfotase alfa was generally effective and safe.","33":"The disruption of oral microbial homeostasis is a major cause of periodontal disease, and the formation of pathogenic plaque biofilms is a key driver of disease progression. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) within dental plaque biofilms provide structural support and a protective barrier, rendering these biofilms markedly resistant to conventional antimicrobial strategies. Owing to their favorable physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and multifunctionality, nanomaterials have attracted widespread attention as potential drug-delivery platforms and therapeutic agents targeting EPS across inorganic, organic, natural-product-derived, and composite systems. This review concentrates on recent advances in the use of nanomaterials, especially nanozymes, for degrading the EPS matrix and treating dental plaque biofilms. It explicates mechanisms by which nanomaterials act, including inhibition of EPS production and adhesion, degradation of polysaccharides and proteins, targeting of extracellular DNA (eDNA), and exploitation of negative surface charge to disrupt biofilm integrity; and we also explored the potential of polypeptide-folded artificial enzymes as multifunctional nanocarriers in combination with other therapeutic modalities. Collectively, these studies furnish a theoretical rationale and technical support for the development of novel, effective antimicrobial strategies and may open new avenues for periodontal therapy. The review also summarizes current challenges in the field of nanomaterial-based and EPS-targeted periodontal treatment and discusses possible approaches to address these obstacles.","34":"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare malignancy typically attributed to occupational asbestos exposure and associated with dismal survival outcomes. The standard of care for unresectable MPM was platinum-based chemotherapy until the approval of immunotherapy in 2020. We examined treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, health care resource use (HCRU), and costs in patients with MPM to understand disease burden before the first immunotherapy approval. This retrospective study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare deidentified database in the US to select patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200965 years who initiated first-line therapy (1L, index event) for advanced MPM (regional extension or distant) diagnosed between 2007 and 2019. Eligible patients had continuous Medicare enrollment from the diagnosis date to\u2009\u2265\u20093 months post-index date, with\u2009\u2265\u20096-month follow-up after 1L initiation. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate real-world time to treatment discontinuation (rwTTD) and overall survival (OS). Data cutoff was December 31, 2020. Among 554 patients with MPM who initiated 1L, median age was 74 years; most were white (95.0%) and male (73.7%). The most common 1L regimens were platinum-pemetrexed (75.6%), pemetrexed monotherapy (8.5%), and bevacizumab-platinum-pemetrexed therapy (8.1%); the median rwTTD of 1L therapy was 5.3 (95% CI, 4.2-6.3) months. Of 554 patients, 300 (54.2%) initiated second-line therapy (2L), and 120 (21.7%) initiated third-line therapy (3L). Platinum-pemetrexed (25.0%) and gemcitabine (25.0%) were the most common 2L and 3L, respectively. Median OS was 16.3 (95% CI, 15.4-17.8) months, with 5-year survival of 7.9% (95% CI, 5.5-10.9). Mean per-patient-per-month all-cause inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and total costs were 0.04, 1.74, 0.18, and $11,432, respectively. The study highlights a substantial clinical and economic burden among patients with advanced MPM who received 1L chemotherapy in the years preceding immunotherapy approvals, underscoring the need for more effective therapies to improve outcomes.","35":"Infantile-onset lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) (Wolman disease, historically) is a rare inherited, rapidly progressive disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the <i>LIPA<\/i> gene, which encodes the enzyme LAL. LAL is essential for the metabolism of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. LAL deficiency leads to the accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides within the lysosomes, macrophages, and parenchymal cells in most tissue types, including those in the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and lymph nodes but excluding the central nervous system. Infants with rapidly progressive LAL-D present with gastrointestinal disturbance, adrenomegaly with calcification, hepatosplenomegaly, growth failure due to malabsorption, and systemic inflammation. If untreated, rapidly progressive LAL-D typically leads to death within the first year of life. Treatment takes the two-pronged approach of sebelipase alfa, a human lysosomal acid lipase enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) that improves lipid metabolism, combined with nutritional management. Dietary substrate (lipid) reduction, known as substrate reduction therapy, is essential for optimal management in LAL-D. Following a nutritional plan and managing gastrointestinal disturbances together reduce systemic inflammation and improve growth, gut function, liver health, quality of life, and survival in patients with infantile-onset LAL-D. A multidisciplinary specialized team is necessary to manage the highly complex, multisystemic conditions in these patients. Nutritional management of LAL-D has evolved with increasing experience with the clinical management of ERT-treated infantile-onset LAL-D. A review of guidance for best practice nutritional management is needed. This narrative review aims to provide updated recommendations and guidance for the optimal nutritional management of infantile-onset LAL-D.","36":"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have transformed cancer therapy for patients harbouring homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficiencies, notably <i>BRCA1\/2<\/i> mutations. However, resistance to PARPi remains a clinical challenge, with restoration of BRCA1 function via hypomorphic variants representing an understudied scenario. Here, we engineered a doxycycline-inducible BRCA1 expression system in the <i>BRCA1<\/i>-mutant, triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDAMB436, permitting controlled analysis of functionally distinct BRCA1 hypomorphs in vitro and in vivo. Among multiple BRCA1 variants generated-including RING, coiled-coil, and BRCT domain mutants-only overexpression of the \u2206exon11 hypomorph robustly conferred resistance to olaparib and carboplatin, with drug sensitivity correlating to \u2206exon11 expression levels. While \u2206exon11 BRCA1 mediated HRR restoration, its efficiency was consistently lower than full-length BRCA1, as measured by RAD51 foci formation and interaction with repair partners such as PALB2. In vivo, tumours expressing \u0394exon11 BRCA1 exhibited only partial resistance to olaparib compared to those expressing full-length BRCA1. Importantly, the combination of olaparib and the ATR inhibitor, ceralasertib, overcame \u2206exon11-mediated resistance, impairing RAD51 foci formation in \u2206exon11-expressing cells. Our findings identify a dose-dependent, hypomorphic HRR restoration by \u2206exon11 BRCA1, help explain the variable resistance observed in BRCA1-mutant pre-clinical models expressing this hypomorph, and propose ATR inhibition in combination with PARPi as a clinical strategy to counteract therapeutic resistance mediated by \u2206exon11 BRCA1 hypomorphs.","37":"The increasing complexity of healthcare decision making and the demand for real-world evidence call for a transformation in how Medical Affairs departments generate and communicate evidence. In response, AstraZeneca Spain implemented a structured stakeholder-driven framework aligned with the Clinical Evidence 2030 and Medical Affairs 2030 visions, aiming to deliver high-impact, timely, and tailored insights across each therapeutic area. An ambitious evidence generation vision was developed around two core components: (1) enhanced therapeutic area knowledge leading to improvements in guideline-directed medical therapy for patients and (2) strategic use of evidence for the company, leading to improved efficiency in delivering healthcare innovation for patients. The first component encompasses a broad spectrum of study modalities, such as the generation of real-world data on the use of medicines, health economics and outcomes research, predictive analytics, clinical management, and patient experience studies using diverse data sources, including real-world databases, registries, and electronic health records. Studies address different research questions and data gaps, including disease burden, treatment patterns, economic modeling, patient experience through ethnographic research, and knowledge derived from artificial intelligence-driven analytics. The second component seeks to ensure that the evidence generated is used strategically. First, it should be the basis for the development of a powerful Value Story that conveys the clinical, economic, and humanistic value of a pharmaceutical product and creates confidence in regulators, payers, and prescribers, thereby strengthening its therapeutic positioning. Second, the evidence generated needs to be presented to stakeholders in a dynamic manner, enhancing decision-making processes and fostering real-time engagement with healthcare providers and payers. Here, we present a data visualization tool that was developed to this end, termed ATLAS. Third, results from real-world evidence studies can be used to inform outcome-based agreements with payers. This type of innovative value strategy that goes beyond traditional financial agreements represents a method to ensure that the clinical and economic value delivered by a product is reflected in healthcare pricing and reimbursement models, facilitating broader access and timely patient care. AstraZeneca Spain's evidence generation approach represents a significant contribution to the evolution of Medical Affairs into a strategic driver of healthcare innovation and, ultimately, patient benefit.

Hyperoxia induces oxidant-mediated acute lung injury (ALI) and pulmonary cell death, called hyperoxic ALI (HALI). Elucidating molecular mechanisms in HALI could identify therapeutic targets in ALI. In the current study, we examined in vivo effects of HALI on Beclin-1 (BCN1), which regulates autophagy, and modulation of BCN1 by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Effects of HALI on BCN1 and autophagy were examined in mice with genetically decreased EGFR (EGFR<sup>Wa5\/+<\/sup>). Wildtype (WT) and EGFR<sup>Wa5\/+<\/sup> mice were exposed to 100% oxygen for 24-72\u2009hours along with normoxia controls (eight groups; n=4-6\/group), and analysis of pulmonary BCN1 and autophagy was completed. In WT, HALI led to increased BCN1 (59% increased total BCN1\/\u03b2-Actin; p<0.01) in lung and alveolar epithelium (484% increased H-score; p<0.001). HALI led to decreased microtubule-associated protein 1B-light chain (LC3B)-II\/-I ratios (43% decrease; p<0.05) and increased p62 (93% increase; p<0.05), suggesting reduced autophagic flux. In human alveolar type-II cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (AT2s<sup>iPSC<\/sup>), HALI caused increased LDH release (130% increase; p<0.0001) and decreased LC3B-II\/-I ratios (32% decrease; p<0.05). We previously showed that EGFR<sup>Wa5\/+<\/sup> mice are protected in HALI. In the current study, EGFR<sup>Wa5\/+<\/sup> mice showed increased pulmonary BCN1 (122% increase; p<0.05), reduced phosphorylated-(p-)\/total BCN1 (47% decrease; p<0.05) and decreased LC3B-II\/-I ratios (70% decrease; p<0.01) in HALI compared with WT. In addition, wortmannin (1\u2009mg\/kg), which decreases BCN1-mediated autophagy, increased mortality in HALI compared with vehicle control (n=10\/group; 18% decreased hours survived; p<0.001). These data delineate a novel cell death pathway in HALI involving BCN1 and EGFR with therapeutic potential.","39":"Pharmacokinetics (PK) has long been differentiated from pharmacodynamics (PD) and biomarkers, yet this distinction undervalues PK's translational relevance. In this Perspective, we propose that PK itself functions as a biomarker that bridges dose, exposure, and response. Using examples from target-mediated drug disposition, antidrug antibodies, cerebrospinal fluid PK, high-dose methotrexate therapy, and anti-infective pharmacology, we illustrate how PK serves as a measurable, predictive, and actionable biomarker that informs drug development, guides decisions, and advances precision medicine.","40":"No abstract available","41":"Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune skin condition associated with a considerable treatment burden and diminished quality of life. The absence of a consensus outcome measure to evaluate therapeutic response has posed a challenge to CLE drug development. The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) was developed in response to this need, incorporating morphological components including erythema, scale, dyspigmentation and scarring, to reflect disease activity and damage. Numerous studies have demonstrated the utility of CLASI in capturing relevant aspects of disease from clinician- and patient-based perspectives; however, no regulatory precedent for use of clinical trial data employing CLASI to evaluate treatment response in CLE exists. Thus, the Lupus Accelerating Breakthroughs Consortium commissioned a working group of members from industry, academia, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CLE patient advocates to address the potential knowledge gaps with CLASI through evidence-based research. Upon reviewing and submitting these data to the FDA, the working group reached alignment that CLASI is a suitable outcome measure for CLE clinical trials, enabling a clearer regulatory path for clinical drug development. The group recognizes the need for additional information to assess what degree of change in CLASI captures clinically meaningful improvement.","42":"The structural diversification of pharmaceutically relevant compounds presents unique challenges to catalytic methodologies that have been developed and optimized on simpler substrates that lack drug-like complexity. Herein, we report a general strategy for carbon-heteroatom (C-X) bond formation through reactions between a wide range of nucleophiles and Ni-based oxidative addition complexes (OACs) of drug-like aryl and heteroaryl electrophiles. These organonickel complexes are easily synthesized by oxidative addition of the corresponding electrophiles under electroreductive conditions using an inexpensive Ni precursor. Redox-induced oxidative coupling from these persistent complexes proved challenging, but mechanistic studies guided the development of a simple aerobic oxidation procedure to rapidly form C-X coupled products. Exposure of the organonickel complexes to ambient air forms a high-valent (peroxo)Ni<sup>(III)<\/sup>Ar complex intermediate that can undergo substitution with a variety of N-, O-, S-, C-, P- or halide-based nucleophiles, which are incorporated into the product. The breadth of this methodology was demonstrated by reactions with unreactive electrophiles, such as aryl chlorides, drug-like (hetero)aryl electrophiles, and small peptides. Finally, the aerobic chemistry was miniaturized to allow for high-throughput exploration of substrate diversity with an equally complex set of nucleophilic partners.","43":"Since the TGN1412 clinical trial failure to predict cytokine release syndrome (CRS) during preclinical trials, alternative <i>in vitro<\/i> models have become increasingly important for identifying potential adverse outcomes in early drug development. Considering this, in 2019 the IMI2\/EU immune safety avatar (imSAVAR) consortium was established, encompassing academic, industry, and regulatory organizations. ImSAVAR aims to deliver a broad range of tools to enhance our ability to assess the efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory therapies. In addition, imSAVAR uses the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept to describe immune-related adverse effects, such as CRS, thereby facilitating the discovery of new biological markers for clinical management and prediction of immune-related adverse effects in nonclinical development. ImSAVAR unanimously agreed that CRS and advanced cytokine release assay (CRA) development is a key focus with regards to immunological safety testing and hazard identification. The CRA field has rapidly accelerated in recent years, with the rise of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) to provide enhanced predictive immunological safety testing within a clinical setting. Here, we provide an up-to-date review of recent developments of advanced, <i>in vitro<\/i> CRA models, discuss how these advances may impact the future field of nonclinical toxicology and the understanding of immune-related adverse outcomes and offer guidance on appropriate model selection.","44":"Clinical remission is an emerging treatment goal in severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA). While benralizumab, an anti-IL-5R\u03b1 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated efficacy in SEA, its ability to induce clinical remission in real-life settings over extended follow-up remains underexplored. This post hoc analysis of the multicenter, retrospective ANANKE study evaluated clinical remission over 24 months in 167 Italian patients with SEA treated with benralizumab. Remission was defined according to the Severe Asthma Network Italy (SANI) criteria. Complete clinical remission (cCR) required the absence of oral corticosteroid (OCS) use and the presence of 3 criteria: no symptoms, no exacerbations, and stable lung function. Partial clinical remission (pCR) required the absence of OCS use and 2 of the 3 criteria. Outcomes were assessed at 3, 12, and 24 months. The proportion of patients achieving clinical remission increased over time: 87.2% at 3 months (40.4% pCR, 46.8% cCR), 95.0% at 12 months (17.5% pCR, 77.5% cCR), and 96.1% at 24 months (23.5% pCR, 72.6% cCR). No baseline demographic or clinical characteristics were found to significantly predict remission status. Blood eosinophil counts declined from a mean of 476.7 to 5.2 cells\/\u03bcL at 24 months. In this real-world Italian cohort, benralizumab was associated with rapid and sustained clinical remission in patients with SEA over 24 months. The high remission rates observed early and maintained throughout treatment support the role of benralizumab as a disease-modifying therapy and reinforce clinical remission as a meaningful therapeutic goal in SEA.","45":"This study examined biomarker alteration prevalence, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes among patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer to investigate racial differences. Analysis of 2,384 patients from the Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine clinico-genomic database (FH-FMI CGDB) (2017-2022) assessed PIK3CA, AKT1, PTEN, ESR1, and BRCA1\/2 alterations via NGS testing. Treatment patterns and overall survival were evaluated. In the study population (13% Black, 87% White), Black patients had lower PIK3CA mutation rates (34% vs. 42%, p\u2009=\u20090.03). In first-line treatment, Black patients were less likely to receive CDK4\/6 inhibitors (53% vs. 66%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and more likely to receive chemotherapy (27% vs. 17%, p\u2009<\u20090.01). After adjustment, Black patients had 38% lower odds of receiving first-line CDK4\/6 inhibitors and experienced significantly shorter median overall survival (34.1 vs. 42.1 months, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Significant differences exist in biomarker prevalence, treatment access, and survival outcomes in HR+\/HER2- metastatic breast cancer by race, highlighting unmet medical needs.","46":"The pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a rapid digital transformation.

Addressing these skills gaps requires coordinated action from academia, industry, and policymakers. By fostering a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and adaptive learning ecosystem, the pharmaceutical sector can equip its workforce to thrive in a rapidly changing landscape and continue improving global health and wellbeing.","47":"Organoids offer superior physiological relevance over traditional 2D and animal models. By recapitulating human tissue architecture, they enable predictive assessments of drug efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (DMPK). Integrating artificial intelligence (AI)-driven modeling further expands their preclinical utility, particularly in oncology. Concurrently, regulatory agencies are establishing standards for organoid validation and qualification. In this review, we summarize current applications and discuss the scientific and regulatory requirements needed to bridge the translational gap. We emphasize that harmonized regulatory frameworks are essential to ensure scientific rigor and facilitate the broader adoption of organoid technologies in drug development.","48":"Open-source statistical software development is increasingly the preferred solution for leveraging new statistical methods in the pharmaceutical industry. However, with a long history of relying on licensed analysis software, there are philosophical and organizational barriers to overcome. In particular, the sustainability, reliability, usability, and feasibility of maintaining open-source statistical software long-term must be ensured. Here, we describe the open-source revolution that is emerging in the pharmaceutical industry and how it facilitates greater scaling of innovative analytical methods in statistics. We discuss challenges to open-source software adoption and propose mitigation strategies. Furthermore, we illustrate the potential for open-source software development with examples of successful projects, which highlight the roles of cross-company collaboration, career paths, education, and community building.","49":"The successful translation of a stem cell-derived product from the laboratory into an approved medicine requires specific scientific, technical, and regulatory understanding. Since this knowledge base is fragmented across websites and publications, the ISSCR has developed a new resource, The Best Practices for the Development of Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Therapies. This comprehensive, interactive document, designed for academia and industry, addresses critical areas of the translational pipeline and key decision points for the successful translation to a licensed therapy. Uniquely, it provides a global perspective of the regulatory landscape while providing resources for critical processes and links to jurisdictional regulatory information."},"url":{"0":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41666253\/","1":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41664886\/","2":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663906\/","3":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662384\/","4":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41661442\/","5":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41655794\/","6":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41655752\/","7":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41654375\/","8":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41654374\/","9":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41650129\/","10":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41649964\/","11":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41647700\/","12":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41647336\/","13":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41644530\/","14":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41638431\/","15":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41638304\/","16":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41637692\/","17":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41637627\/","18":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41635454\/","19":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41634464\/","20":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41632514\/","21":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41630589\/","22":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41628709\/","23":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41627441\/","24":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41621793\/","25":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41618947\/","26":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41617465\/","27":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41614412\/","28":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41613352\/","29":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41612563\/","30":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41611876\/","31":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41609129\/","32":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41608645\/","33":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41607216\/","34":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41604116\/","35":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41599846\/","36":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41595228\/","37":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41593265\/","38":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41592865\/","39":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41591764\/","40":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41591646\/","41":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41588246\/","42":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41585002\/","43":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41583485\/","44":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41583079\/","45":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41577681\/","46":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41577303\/","47":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41577171\/","48":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41577168\/","49":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41576937\/"}}
