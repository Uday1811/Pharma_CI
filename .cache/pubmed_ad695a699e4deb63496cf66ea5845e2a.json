However, high-throughput SCRS datasets often contain spectral anomalies from noise and fluorescence interference, which obscure microbial signatures and hinder accurate classification. Robust algorithms for outlier detection and microbial ramanome analysis remain underdeveloped. Here, we introduce RamEx, an R package specifically designed for high-throughput microbial ramanome analyses with robust quality control and phenotypic classification. At the core of RamEx is the Iterative Convolutional Outlier Detection (ICOD) algorithm, which dynamically detects spectral anomalies without requiring predefined thresholds. Benchmarking on both simulated and real microbial datasets-including pathogenic bacteria, probiotic strains, and yeast fermentation populations-demonstrated that ICOD achieves an F1 score of 0.97 on simulated datasets and 0.74 on real datasets, outperforming existing approaches by at least 19.8%. Beyond anomaly detection, RamEx provides a modular and scalable workflow for microbial phenotype differentiation, taxonomic marker identification, metabolic-associated fingerprinting, and intra-population heterogeneity analysis. It integrates Raman-based species-specific biomarkers, enabling precise classification of microbial communities and facilitating functional trait mapping at the single-cell level. To support large-scale studies, RamEx incorporates C++\u2009acceleration, GPU parallelization, and optimized memory management, enabling the rapid processing of over one million microbial spectra within an hour. By bridging the gap between high-throughput Raman-based microbial phenotyping and computational analysis, RamEx provides a comprehensive toolkit for exploring microbial ecology, metabolic interactions, and antibiotic susceptibility at the single-cell resolution.

Video Abstract.","1":"O-Methyltransferases (OMTs) play crucial roles in plant defense, environmental adaptation, and quality formation by catalyzing the biosynthesis of diverse methylated metabolites. Although OMT (COMT and CCoAOMT) genes have been functionally characterized in various plant species, the evolutionary trajectory of the entire OMT gene family and the functional divergence of the CCoAOMT subfamily remain to be systematically elucidated. In this study, we performed pan-genome analysis of the OMT gene family in 61 tomato (Solanum spp.) accessions and conducted phylogenetic analysis across 20 plant species (from algae to angiosperms), identifying 2,882 OMT genes. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that all extant plant CCoAOMT genes evolved from a single ancestral lineage (Clade I) originating before the divergence of red and green algae. In tomato, 2,199 OMT genes were classified into 42 orthogroups: nine core, five soft-core, 22 dispensable, and six private orthogroups, with 52.4% classified as dispensable genes. OMT genes in the Solanum genus have predominantly undergone purifying selection. Among all COMT orthogroups, a single tandem duplicate cluster stands out as exclusively conserved. Members of this cluster have evolved a distinct catalytic role, as evidenced by the finding that SlCOMT2c exclusively catalyzes the formation of kaempferide via the 4'-O-methylation of kaempferol. Ion mobility spectrometry showed that SlAOMT, a member of the CCoAOMT-like subfamily, catalyzes the methylation of luteolin to produce two isomeric products identified as diosmetin and chrysoeriol while losing the canonical catalytic function of the CCoAOMT subfamily. In addition, we identified a potential gene regulatory network associated with methylated flavonoid biosynthesis. This study establishes an integrative framework for elucidating OMT evolution and provides analytical tools for identifying genes involved in isomeric methylated flavonoid biosynthesis, paving the way for studying adaptive evolution and specialized metabolic pathways in plants.","2":"Between 2010 and 2019, international travel increased by approximately 52.2%, highlighting the world's dependence on transportation for global connectivity. Although travel enhances global interactions, it also poses risks to public health through the potential transmission of diseases. The rapid global transmission of infectious diseases, exemplified by the outbreaks of COVID-19 and Zika virus, underscores the critical need for in-depth research into travel-associated disease dissemination. When individuals travel, they are exposed to a variety of diverse microbial environments, which can affect their healthy microbiome. In this review, we introduce the concept of \"travel microbiota\" to encapsulate the dynamic shifts in human microbial communities induced by travel across different transportation modes. This disruption can affect metabolic and immune functions and potentially facilitate the spread of diseases. Given these implications, it is crucial to investigate how different modes of transportation affect the human microbiota. Our study reviews the impact of travel on the human microbiota, highlighting differences across transportation modes. The objective is to establish a framework for understanding travel health and the role of microbiota in managing travel-related health risks. A comprehensive understanding of this relationship is essential for developing preventive strategies to safeguard and restore the human microbiota. To provide the specific content, relevant publications were identified on Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct using specific keywords such as dysbiosis, gut, health, microbiome, microbiota, pathogens, travel, and transportation. We did not add any limits to the publication date during the inclusion of papers. However, it is noteworthy that the initial reports, including the aforementioned keywords, have been published starting from 2015. Travel has a profound impact on the human microbiota, and it is essential to consider the implications associated with various modes of transportation. Traveling through various modes of transportation, such as roadways, airways, and maritime, has significantly influenced human microbiota. Moreover, it acts as a dynamic interface for microbial exchange driving rapid shift in microbial diversity, community convergence, and the diversification of resistant genes. However, the underlying mechanism of these changes remains elusive. By integrating evidence across multiple modes of transportation, this review highlights travel as an underrecognized determinant of microbiome variability and introduces the term \"Travel microbiota\". Moreover, this review is pivotal for understanding the ways in which travel alters microbial diversity and developing effective interventions. It is imperative to conduct future research that focuses on conducting large-scale longitudinal studies to assess the effects of traveling on microbial composition and to develop potential preventive measures.","3":"No abstract available","4":"Cadmium (Cd) contamination poses a serious threat to crop productivity and food safety. Although cysteine (Cys) has been implicated in Cd detoxification, its regulatory role in Chinese cabbage remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that exogenous Cys alleviates Cd toxicity by enhancing root Cd retention and coordinating multiple detoxification pathways. Cys restored biomass accumulation, root elongation, and photosynthetic performance while mitigating Cd-induced oxidative damage. Root vigour increased by 44.4%, accompanied by enhanced Cd sequestration in roots and restricted translocation to shoots. Cd concentrations in xylem sap decreased by 42.0%, and shoot Cd accumulation declined by 23.1%-44.6%. Although Cys increased Cd influx and root Cd accumulation, it inhibited long-distance Cd transport by repressing BraIRT1 and BraHMA2 expression. Cys further strengthened vacuolar immobilization by up-regulating BraABCC1\/2 and BraPCS1, increasing GSH and PC2-PC4 contents, and improving the GSH\/GSSG ratio, thereby supporting Cd chelation and redox homoeostasis. Time-resolved transcriptomics revealed attenuation of Cd-induced sulphate assimilation hyperactivation, enhanced GSH regeneration, and a metabolic shift from lignin biosynthesis toward glycosylated phenylpropanoid detoxification products, as validated by qRT-PCR. Together, these results identify Cys as a practical strategy to reduce shoot Cd accumulation in leafy vegetables by limiting Cd mobility at both cellular and whole-plant levels.","5":"No abstract available","6":"No abstract available","7":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant liver tumor with poor clinical outcomes. Accumulated evidence has demonstrated lactylation plays a vital role in the metabolic reprogramming. However the mechanisms underlying the role of lactylation in the regulation of HCC progression remain largely unknown. This study aims to construct a prognostic model based on lactylation-related metabolism genes, and further explore its prognostic significance and biological function in HCC. In this study, a robust prognostic prediction model has been constructed employing a complex machine learning framework using public bulk RNA-seq and proteomic HCC dataset. Moreover, the clinical application of this model was explored, and its biological functions were validated using several in vitro experiments. Subsequently, we performed functional analysis, survival analysis, tumor immune microenvironment analysis and drug sensitivity to demonstrate our model's potential in translational cancer medicine. We developed an integrative machine learning-based computational framework to generate a predictive Metabolism-related Lactylation Index (MRLI) within four independent HCC cohorts and validated its prognostic accuracy through various algorithms. Notably, compared to published gene signatures, MRLI demonstrated robust predictive capability. In addition, single-cell analysis demonstrated that the MRLI is predominantly localized within HCC cells and correlates with tumor malignancy. Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested that the MRLI may be associated with cellular proliferation and metabolic reprogramming, which was further confirmed by experimental evidence. Subsequently, public spatial transcriptomics and bulk RNA-seq analysis revealing that the highly MRLI predicts a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, which was further verification in a cohort of 40 HCC samples by multiple immunofluorescence. Additionally, groups with highly MRLI showed decreased sensitivity to sorafenib, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and TACE, highlighting the potential of MRLI in facilitating personalized treatment strategies. Our study has developed a novel MRLI as a predictive marker for prognosis and therapeutic outcomes in patients with HCC. These findings indicate that lactylation promotes malignant cell phenotypes and immune microenvironment remodeling partially through metabolic regulation, suggesting it as a potential clinical therapeutic target.","8":"Cavins, in concert with caveolins, orchestrate the formation and function of caveolae-specialized invaginations of the plasma membrane involved in mechanotransduction, lipid homeostasis, and cell signaling. The Cavin family comprises four members: Cavins 1-3, which are broadly expressed, and Cavin4, which is muscle-specific. Disruption of Cavin function via genetic mutations, epigenetic silencing, or altered expression is linked to a spectrum of caveolae-related disorders, including lipodystrophy, muscular dystrophies, insulin resistance, and cancer. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the physiological roles, pathophysiological implications, and therapeutic potential of cavins, with emphasis on their involvement in cancer, metabolic diseases, and muscle disorders, highlighting their value as biomarkers and molecular targets in precision medicine. Specifically, Cavin1 serves as the central structural and functional scaffold of caveolae, linking mechanoprotection, lipid metabolism, and ribosomal RNA transcription to cellular stress adaptation and disease pathogenesis, whereas Cavin2 modulates caveolae morphology and signaling, with emerging roles in insulin sensitivity and inflammatory regulation. Cavin3, in turn, is considered a dynamic regulator of caveolae turnover and signal integration, linking caveolar function to cell signaling, DNA damage responses, and tumor suppression. Finally, Cavin4 plays a critical role in muscle-specific caveolae organization, mechanotransduction, and hypertrophic signaling. In the context of tumorigenesis, cavins together represent promising therapeutic targets due to their capacity to induce apoptosis, inhibit cancer cell migration and invasion, and modulate inflammatory responses; however, their roles appear to be context-dependent, with expression patterns and functional outcomes varying across tissue types.","9":"Ethnically diverse populations can present variations in cardiovascular risk, which can be influenced by differences in lipid profiles and other cardiovascular risk factors. This study aimed to evaluate lipid profiles and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in a Mediterranean population, with a focus on variations by ethnicity and sex. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study using the \"Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care\" (SIDIAP) database, which includes primary care data from Catalonia, Spain, collected between 2015 and 2019. The study included subjects aged 40 to 89 years with no prior history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or lipid-lowering therapy. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare lipid profiles and traditional risk factors across ethnic groups and sex. We included 806,458 participants, 56.8% women, 89.9% from Southern Europe, 5.3% from Latin America and Caribbean origin, 3% from North Africa, 0.8% from Central\/South Africa and 1% from Asia. Asian individuals presented the most atherogenic lipid profile, with the lower HDL-C, higher triglyceride levels, and elevated atherogenic indices. Higher LDL-C values were observed in Latin American men and Southern European women. Among the groups studied, Central and South Africans presented the most favorable lipid profiles, with low triglyceride and atherogenic indices, regardless of sex. North Africans and Latin Americans presented higher obesity rates, whilst southern Europeans presented the highest prevalence rates of hypertension and smoking. Individuals from Asia have worse lipid and metabolic profile compared with Central and South African individuals, regardless of sex. Current risk assessment tools may underestimate the cardiovascular risk in these specific populations.","10":"Although androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies have shown notable clinical efficacy in prostate cancer (PCa), the emergence of drug resistance remains a critical factor driving the clinical prognosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Aberrant tumor lipid metabolism not only fulfills the energetic and biosynthetic requirements of rapidly proliferating cancer cells but also contributes to the development of therapeutic resistance. We examined SOX8 expression in enzalutamide resistance (EnzR) cell lines and validated its association with tumor progression and clinical outcome. The malignant phenotypes related to EnzR were assessed in vitro using PCa cell lines with stable SOX8 overexpression or knockdown. Tumor xenografts were subsequently generated by inoculating the corresponding cell lines into nude mice. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted RNA-seq, CUT&Tag, non-targeted metabolomics, and a series of molecular and biochemical assays. SOX8 expression was elevated in EnzR prostate cancer cell lines and positively correlated with poor patient prognosis. Reduced SOX8 expression enhanced cellular sensitivity to enzalutamide, whereas elevated SOX8 expression decreased drug responsiveness. Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) assays revealed that AR was enriched at the SOX8 promoter region and transcriptionally repressed SOX8. In vivo, stable SOX8 knockdown markedly suppressed tumor growth in nude mouse xenografts. Mechanistically, SOX8 promotes the EnzR by reprograming lipid metabolism and we identified carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), a key enzyme in lipid metabolism, as a novel downstream target of SOX8. SOX8-driven lipid metabolic reprogramming promoted enzalutamide resistance through the SOX8\/CPT2 axis. High SOX8 expression promotes EnzR in PCa, suggesting SOX8 as a potential therapeutic target. Our findings demonstrate that SOX8 drives EnzR by activating the SOX8\/CPT2 axis, thereby inducing lipid metabolic reprogramming in PCa cells.","11":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk, and subclinical vascular damage can be evaluated using carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and arterial stiffness measures such as pulse wave velocity (PWV). Sortilin and sclerostin have been proposed as cardiometabolic biomarkers, but their value in identifying early cardiovascular risk in PCOS remains unclear. To compare serum sortilin and sclerostin levels and subclinical vascular markers (CIMT and PWV) between women with PCOS and controls, and to evaluate whether these biomarkers are independently associated with CIMT. In this case-control study, women with PCOS and age-matched controls were assessed for clinical and metabolic variables. Serum sortilin and sclerostin concentrations were measured, and CIMT and PWV were obtained using standardized protocols. Between-group comparisons were performed, and multivariable linear regression models were constructed with CIMT as the dependent variable. CIMT was significantly higher in women with PCOS compared with controls, whereas PWV did not differ significantly between groups. Circulating sortilin and sclerostin levels were comparable between groups and were not independently associated with CIMT after multivariable adjustment. CIMT appears to be a more sensitive marker of early subclinical atherosclerosis in young women with PCOS than circulating sortilin or sclerostin. These biomarkers cannot currently be recommended for early cardiovascular risk assessment in PCOS. Larger, phenotype-stratified and longitudinal studies are needed to clarify their potential prognostic relevance in specific subgroups.","12":"Patients with cardio-kidney-metabolic (CKM) disease are at high risk of long-term mortality. While several metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers have been investigated, their relative prognostic value in real-world CKM populations remains uncertain. We aimed to develop and internally validate a Cox-based prognostic model for long-term all-cause mortality, with a particular focus on serum albumin and inflammatory markers. We conducted a prospective cohort study including 480 patients across the CKM spectrum. Participants were followed for up to 11 years, with all-cause mortality as the primary outcome. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed using prespecified clinical variables, including age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum albumin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), body mass index, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus defined by laboratory criteria (HbA1c\u2009\u2265\u20096.5% and\/or fasting plasma glucose\u2009\u2265\u2009126\u00a0g\/dL). Model performance was assessed using Harrell's C-index with internal validation by bootstrap resampling. Proportional hazards assumptions were evaluated using Schoenfeld residuals, with sensitivity analyses addressing time-varying effects. Among 480 participants, 114 deaths (23.8%) occurred during a median 10-year follow-up. In multivariable Cox models, age and coronary artery disease were consistently associated with higher all-cause mortality across all model specifications. Higher serum albumin levels were independently protective in models including laboratory-defined diabetes (HR 0.52 per 1\u00a0g\/dL, 95% CI 0.30-0.93) and clinical history of diabetes (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.86). Laboratory-defined diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased mortality risk (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.36-3.69), whereas clinically documented diabetes mellitus showed an inverse association (HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.08-0.35). Measures of renal function, inflammatory burden assessed by log-transformed hs-CRP, body mass index, hypertension, and sex were not independently associated with mortality. In this real-world cohort spanning the cardiorenal-metabolic spectrum, serum albumin emerged as a robust and independent protective prognostic marker for long-term all-cause mortality, even after adjustment for age, comorbidities, renal function, and inflammatory burden. Age and coronary artery disease consistently predicted mortality across all model specifications. These findings highlight the value of serum albumin as an integrative biomarker reflecting nutritional status, systemic inflammation, and disease severity, with potential implications for refined risk stratification in patients with complex cardiorenal-metabolic conditions. Routine assessment of serum albumin may support pragmatic prognostic stratification in cardiorenal-metabolic populations.","13":"Postharvest pepper fruits undergo quality deterioration including water loss, shrinkage and nutritional decline, which limits their commercial value. Notably, nano-silicon (SiNPs) improves postharvest vegetable quality, but its regulatory mechanism on pepper storage quality, especially metabolic changes, remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored SiNPs effects on P70 pepper phenotype, storage quality and metabolism to optimize postharvest preservation. SiNPs treatment significantly improved P70 pepper fruits storage quality. Under roomtemperature (RT) and low temperature (LT) storage conditions, SiNPs treatment (RT-NP, LT-NP) effectively alleviated shrinkage, water loss, and hardness decline. After 6 days of storage, LT-NP group had 1.09-fold higher hardness than LT group, while LT group weight loss was 1.46-fold that of LT-NP. For nutritional quality indicators, SiNPs treatment maintained higher contents of vitamin C, flavonoids, soluble solids and soluble sugar. In terms of antioxidant capacity, SiNPs treatment enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase; LT-NP had 1.11-fold higher SOD at 6 days and 1.54-fold higher POD at 4 days than LT. Metabolomic analysis detected1041 metabolites, mainly including flavonoids (22.1%) and phenolic acids (13.7%). Compared with LT group, LT-NP had 164 up- and 79 down-regulated differential metabolites, enriched in flavonoid biosynthesis, starch-sucrose and amino acid metabolism. LT-NP up-regulated flavonoids (Galangin, Apigenin), D-Sucrose and activated polyamine biosynthesis. SiNPs improves P70 pepper postharvest quality by reducing water loss, maintaining hardness and nutrients. Collectively, the mechanism involves enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity and regulated key metabolites in flavonoid, sugar and amino acid pathways, supporting SiNPs application in pepper postharvest preservation.","14":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by metabolic reprogramming that supports tumour growth and survival. This study identifies farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPs), a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, as a critical regulator of HCC proliferation and apoptosis. We applied bioinformatics analysis through TCGA and GSE database to identify the expression of FDPs within HCC patients. Then, mechanistic studies were conducted including Western blots, apoptosis assay, RT-qPCR, rescue assay, RNA-sequencing, in\u00a0vivo study to prove the role of FDPs in regulating HCC progression. FDPs was found to be significantly upregulated in HCC tissues, and its down-regulation promotes tumour cell apoptosis while inhibiting tumour cell proliferation in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Mechanistically, we identified FDPs regulate glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) by RNA sequencing, bioinformatics prediction, and rescue experiments, indicating its involvement in glycolysis regulation in tumour cells. The identification of this FDPs-G6PD axis suggests a novel metabolic pathway contributing to HCC development. In summary, this study highlights FDPs play an essential oncogenic role in HCC, linking it to metabolic reprogramming and tumour survival. These findings establish FDPs as a promising therapeutic target, offering a foundation for further exploration of its regulatory mechanisms and potential clinical applications.","15":"Taste is one of the important factors for evaluating the quality of tea. Smart tongue and metabolomics were used to analyze the difference in taste of Gongou black teas from three different varieties. In this study, 564 non-volatile metabolites (NVMs) were identified in the black teas. The quality difference between Shuyong 3 black tea (SY-T) and Fuding Dabai black tea was the greatest, followed by SY-T and Sichuan Small and Medium-leaf black tea. Specially, the differential NVMs primarily influenced the astringency, sourness, umami, and bitterness taste attributes of black teas, rather than sweetness. Based on the correlation results between differential NVMs and the taste of black tea, and in combination with the VIP value\u2009\u2265\u20091.5, 24 characteristic differential NVMs that might have a significant impact on the formation of different taste qualities were successfully screened out. In the withering process, the differential metabolic pathways of three different varieties were primarily concentrated in flavonoid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways, which was potentially explaining the main cause of alterations in the characteristic metabolites and the taste profiles of the black teas. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the taste variations among different varieties, as well as a new insights into the quality formation of black tea during the withering process.","16":"Insulin is an important endocrine peptide hormone with pleiotropic effects on metabolic regulation and cellular growth. Insulin resistance (IR), characterized by insensitivity of metabolic tissues to insulin stimulation, has emerged as a major impediment to overall metabolic health. Triggered by multiple environmental factors and genetic predisposition, IR paves the way for several related diseases, including metabolic associated diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Of note, the liver plays a central role in whole-body metabolism and is the portal encountering high concentrations of insulin. Excess glucose, lipids and the compensatory hyperinsulinemia resulting from IR may collectively impose a huge burden on the liver, driving the progression of chronic liver diseases and fostering a pro-carcinogenic environment by increasing mutagenic susceptibility and angiogenic dysregulation. Better understanding of this mechanistic link is important to highlight the underestimated role of IR in progressive diseases and may contribute to stratified diagnosis and treatment. This review summarizes the risk factors and molecular mechanisms of IR, with a specific focus on its role in carcinogenesis, taking hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as an example. Finally, we discuss the effective lifestyle and pharmacological interventions for IR and emphasize the necessity of incorporating IR management into the prevention, stratified diagnosis and treatment of HCC.","17":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) risk is influenced by sex hormones and steatotic liver disease (SLD), but their interplay in women remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the impact of various SLD statuses on AF risk among premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Total 2,181,691 women from the 2009 Korean National Health Insurance Service screenings were analyzed, excluding those with prior AF, hysterectomy, liver cancer, or transplantation. Participants were classified by menopausal status and SLD type: No SLD, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), MASLD with combined etiologies, MASLD and increased alcohol intake (MetALD), and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Over 8.3 years of follow-up, postmenopausal women (n\u2009=\u2009903,079) were older with higher body mass index and comorbidities, while premenopausal women (n\u2009=\u20091,278,613) more often smoked and consumed alcohol. In premenopausal women, AF incidence ranged from 0.65 per 1,000 person-years without SLD to 1.67 in ALD, with the highest hazard ratio in ALD (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.27-3.67). Postmenopausal women showed higher absolute AF incidence (3.43-5.44) but attenuated hazard ratios, peaking at 1.66 in ALD. SLD is significantly associated with increased AF risk, peaking in premenopausal women with MASLD or ALD; these findings necessitate early cardiovascular risk assessment and AF screening, warranting further research into preventive strategies. These novel findings establish a significant association between SLD and increased AF risk across all menopausal stages, demonstrating that the highest relative risk is disproportionately concentrated in premenopausal women with MASLD or ALD, thus underscoring the urgent need for enhanced cardiovascular surveillance and status-specific primary prevention strategies in this overlooked younger population.","18":"The decline in estrogen following menopause is a major driver of metabolic and immune dysfunction in aging females. While hormone replacement therapy improves many of these outcomes, its clinical use remains limited due to concerns regarding estrogen-sensitive malignancies. Tissue-selective estrogen complexes (TSECs), which combine estrogens with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen (TAM), represent a promising strategy to preserve the metabolic and immunological benefits of estrogen while reducing oncogenic risk. However, the systemic effects of TAM under conditions of estrogen deficiency remain incompletely defined. In this study, we investigated the metabolic and immunomodulatory actions of low-dose TAM, alone or in combination with 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), in adult ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. OVX resulted in increased adiposity, hepatic steatosis, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) concentration, and systemic inflammation, along with decreased immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) concentration. E2, TAM, and E2\u2009+\u2009TAM each attenuated OVX-induced adipose expansion, adipocyte hypertrophy, and proinflammatory cytokine production. TAM improved insulin sensitivity but did not fully restore glucose tolerance. Transcriptomic analysis of visceral adipose tissue-resident B cells revealed that E2 and E2\u2009+\u2009TAM modulate overlapping yet distinct immune-regulatory networks, including suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling, regulation of immune checkpoints, and genes linked to adipose homeostasis. Low-dose TAM emerges as a modulator of estrogen receptor signaling that attenuates multiple features of OVX-induced metabolic and inflammatory dysfunction, though its limited effect on glycemic control highlights the need for tissue-specific evaluation of SERM-based interventions. These findings provide mechanistic insight into endocrine-immune-metabolic interactions and inform strategies to reduce aging-related disease risk in postmenopausal women.","19":"Developing cells undergo extensive metabolic adaptations to support growth and differentiation. Here, using spatially resolved mass spectrometry imaging and stable isotope tracing, we systematically investigate metabolic remodeling in mouse brains at postnatal day 14 and day 28, a period coinciding with the transition from a maternal milk diet to solid food. Untargeted metabolomics reveals global shifts in lipid composition, and region-specific remodeling of central energy metabolism, including increased glycolytic intermediates in grey matter-enriched regions and a global decrease in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites after weaning. Despite these marked changes in metabolite levels, the glucose incorporation rate remains constant across these developmental stages. Notably, weaning mice onto a milk-replacement diet demonstrates that the observed metabolic adaptations are largely diet-independent. Together, our data suggest that postnatal brain metabolic remodeling is an intrinsically programmed feature of maturation providing region-specific metabolic reorganization to support developmental demands.","20":"The occurrence and development of a wide range of preeclampsia (PE), especially early-onset preeclampsia (EOPE), is closely associated with the immune system. The objective of this research is to utilize machine learning techniques to discover key immune biomarkers and evaluate their predictive potential. We sourced mRNA expression profiles from the GSE60438\u2009+\u2009GSE75010 dataset in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and retrieved immune-related genes from the ImmPort database. Subsequently, we selected immune genes associated with EOPE and late-onset preeclampsia (LOPE) for differential expression analysis. We then carried out Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses on different immune-related genes (DIRGs). Protein\u2012protein interaction (PPI) networks were employed to investigate the relationships among various DIRGs. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multiple support vector machine recursive feature elimination (mSVM-RFE) analyses, we identified candidate biomarkers for EOPE. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the diagnostic capability of the candidate genes, and a nomogram was constructed to evaluate the performance of the predictive models. To further validate our findings, we analyzed additional GEO datasets (GSE22526\u2009+\u2009GSE74341\u2009+\u2009GSE190639*) and performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on placental tissue to confirm the expression levels and diagnostic values of key genes. Eventually, we utilized the CIBERSORT algorithm to analyze the compositional patterns of the infiltration of 22 immune cell types in EOPE. A total of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 7 DIRGs (HLA-DPA1, FPR1, CGB5, LYZ, LEP, PROK2, and SERPINA3) were discovered through a comparison between LOPE and EOPE. Upon conducting GO analyses, it was determined that DIRGs showed significant enrichment in positive regulation of T cell, lymphocyte, and mononuclear cell proliferation. The KEGG enrichment analysis predominantly demonstrated associations with Immune disease, Endocrine and metabolic disease, and Cardiovascular disease. We identified HLA-DPA1, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II gene involved in antigen presentation and immune regulation, as a potential diagnostic biomarker for EOPE, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.758. Its downregulation in EOPE suggests a potential role in impaired maternal-fetal immune tolerance. Clinical sample analysis revealed that decreased expression levels of HLA-DPA1 were associated with EOPE. Moreover, immune microenvironment analysis indicated that the expression of HLA-DPA1 exhibited a negative correlation with regulatory T cells and Dendritic cells activated, a positive correlation with macrophages M1 and Mast cells resting. Immunity is a key factor in the pathogenesis of placenta in EOPE. HLA-DPA1 can be identified as a key immune gene associated with immune cells, and these findings provide novel perspectives for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of EOPE.","21":"The human brain requires a continuous supply of energy to function effectively. Here, we investigated how the low-dimensional organization of intrinsic functional connectivity patterns based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging relates to brain energy expenditure measured by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. By incrementally adding more dimensions of brain organization (via functional gradients), we show that increasing amounts of variance in the map of brain energy expenditure are accounted for. Dimensions of brain organization that explained much of the variance in intrinsic brain function also accounted for a substantial share of regional variance in energy expenditure maps. This relationship was especially pronounced for maps based on the strongest connections, suggesting that weaker connections may contribute less to explaining regional energy variance. Notably, our topological model was more effective than random brain organization configurations, suggesting that brain organization may be specifically associated with energy optimization. Our results demonstrate how the spatial organization of functional connections is systematically linked to optimized energy expenditure in the human brain, providing new insights into the metabolic basis of brain function.","22":"Imaging is essential for probing cancer biology and tumor surveillance in humans. Combining isotopically labeled substrates with advanced imaging approaches yields a new platform, metabolic imaging. Although cancer metabolism research began ~100 years ago, breakthroughs in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) like hyperpolarization, deuterium metabolic imaging, and novel probes have revolutionized our ability to appreciate deregulated glycolysis in cancer. Here, we discuss the state and future of glycolytic imaging with MRI.","23":"This scoping review synthesizes research on \"Microplastics Exposure During Perinatal Period: Impacts on Neonatal Immune and Metabolic Programming \" to address gaps in understanding how micro- and nano plastics affect neonatal physiological systems and health trajectories. This scoping review aims to evaluate mechanisms of immune and metabolic disruption, benchmark experimental models, characterize size- and dose-dependent effects, and elucidate exposure pathways influencing neonatal outcomes. This also analyses the experimental animal studies, human clinical data, and in vitro models, focusing on biodistribution, molecular effects, and long-term consequences. Findings reveal that micro- and nano plastics cross placental and lactational barriers, accumulating in fetal and neonatal tissues, with smaller particles exhibiting greater translocation and toxicity. Immune programming is disrupted via inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota dysbiosis, while metabolic disturbances include lipid dysregulation, hepatic inflammation, and persistent obesity risk. Neurodevelopmental impairments and reproductive toxicity with transgenerational effects were documented predominantly in animal models. Methodological heterogeneity and limited human longitudinal data constrain translational relevance. Integrating these findings underscores the critical impact of early-life microplastic exposure on immune and metabolic programming with potential lifelong health consequences. These insights highlight the need for standardized exposure assessment, multidisciplinary research, and targeted public health interventions to mitigate risks during sensitive developmental windows.","24":"Fungi that live in deep-sea sediments experience extreme environmental conditions, yet little is known about how they adapt their growth and metabolism to these stresses. This study explores the morphogenetic and metabolomic responses of three black yeasts-Salinomyces thailandicus, Neophaeotheca triangularis, and N. salicorniae-isolated from deep-sea sediments of the Gulf of Mexico under varying salinities and exposure to the melanin inhibitor pthalide. Each species displays distinct growth adaptations: S. thailandicus shifts from filamentous to yeast-like forms as salinity increases, N. triangularis exhibits the opposite trend, and N. salicorniae remains dimorphic but grows more slowly at high salinities. Phthalide inhibits hyphal development in all three species. An exploratory metabolic analysis, conducted on pooled samples, indicates that metabolomic profiles change with salinity, with fatty acids dominating across species, suggesting membrane remodeling as an adaptation to osmotic stress. N. triangularis uniquely accumulates amino acids and peptides, a response previously reported mainly in plants. Additional metabolites, including aminocyclitols and compounds associated with extracellular polymeric substances, suggest the involvement of uncharacterized adaptive mechanisms contributing to stress protection. These findings advance our understanding of how black yeasts adapt to osmotic stress and provide a foundation for future studies.","25":"Diet influences plaque stability through its potential to modulate inflammation, a process that involves complex interactions among various lipid metabolites. This study aims to utilize metabolomics to identify key metabolites involved in this pathway and to elucidate the mechanisms by which dietary factors affect plaque stability. The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), derived from dietary data, was used to assess the inflammatory potential of individual diets. Propensity score matching categorized serum samples from coronary heart disease (CHD) patients into an anti-inflammatory group (n\u2009=\u2009108) and a pro-inflammatory group (n\u2009=\u2009108). A comprehensive analysis of lipid profiles was performed using an UPLC-MS\/MS detection platform combined with the broad-targeted lipid metabolomics technique, and lipid metabolites with significant differences were screened out. Concurrently, we measured serum levels of inflammatory factors and plaque stability. A Bayesian network model was then applied to elucidate the causal relationships among DII, lipid metabolites, inflammatory factors, and plaque stability. A lipidomics analysis identified 22 differentially expressed lipid metabolites, which were associated with sphingolipid metabolism pathways in the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database, particularly involving nine ceramide species. The Bayesian network model exploring the impact of DII on plaque stability comprises 16 nodes and 23 directed arcs. It revealed multiple causal relationships among DII, ceramide species, inflammatory factors, and plaque stability. Specifically, six ceramide species [Cer(d16:0\/20:1), Cer(d24:3\/15:1), Cer(t14:1\/21:0), Cer(t20:0\/18:2), Cer(t22:1\/16:1), Cer(t26:1\/12:1)] and five inflammatory factors (IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-12, IL-13) were found to be involved in these associations. Ceramide species emerged as differential lipid metabolites that distinguish between the anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory groups, simultaneously serving as key lipid metabolic products through which diet exerts its influence on plaque stability.","26":"The worldwide escalation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) necessitates the search for new bioactive agents from natural sources. Consequently, this study investigates the antimicrobial activity of endophytic Streptomyces spp. Eighteen Streptomyces isolates were recovered from sixteen peanut root samples using nitrate starch agar at 30\u00a0\u00b0C for 7 days. Among these, two strains, Streptomyces rochei RSA1 and Streptomyces sp. RSA2, exhibited significant antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) bacteria, compared with six standard antibiotics. Nine metabolic bioactive compounds were identified using GC-MS. However, two compounds2-(butylthio) pyrimidine-4,6(1\u00a0H,5\u00a0H)-dione and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol were particularly prominent (>\u200996% abundance). Functional groups were confirmed via FT-IR spectra. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations with relevant bacterial protein targets (PDB ID: 6FJH, 1O9G, 1J5E, and 9QT5) revealed strong hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, with S. rochei RSA1 forming the most stable complex. Overall, peanut-derived endophytic Streptomyces represent promising sources of bioactive antibacterial metabolites for combating multidrug-resistant infections.","27":"The mcPHASES (menstrual cycle Physiological, Hormonal, and Self-Reported Events and Symptoms) dataset provides a multimodal record of menstrual health that integrates physiological monitoring, hormone measurements, and self-reported experiences. Forty-two Canadian young adults who menstruate participated in a 3-month observation period, and 20 of them also completed a second 3-month observation period. During data collection, participants wore Fitbit Sense smartwatches to capture diverse physiological signals and Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitors for metabolic data. Hormone levels were obtained using at-home Mira Plus urinalysis tests, and daily symptom and lifestyle information (e.g., pain, sleep, stress) was reported through surveys. In total, the dataset comprises 23 structured tables organized by signal category, allowing for analyses that link endocrine dynamics to wearable-derived measures and self-reported outcomes. This resource supports investigations into cycle variability, hormone-physiology interactions, and contextual influences on menstrual health, while also offering benchmark data for developing predictive algorithms and advancing menstrual health informatics.","28":"Antarctic krill oil (KO) is a richsource of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Endogenous PUFA-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) have garnered attention due to their beneficial effects on body, especially the cardiovascular system. This study integrated non-targeted and targeted lipidomics to investigate KO's time-dependent effects on the comprehensive lipid profile and SPMs in rats. After 1- and 6-week supplementation, KO significantly altered lipid profiles, reducing arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4)-containing lipids while elevating eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5)\/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6)-containing lipids. Targeted analysis identified and quantified 33 PUFA-derived oxylipins, including derivatives of ARA, 8 derivatives of EPA, and 13 derivatives of DHA. Notably, KO consumption substantially decreased pro-inflammatory oxylipins like LTB<sub>4<\/sub>, PGE<sub>2<\/sub>, and TXB<sub>2<\/sub>, while increasing anti-inflammatory LXA<sub>4<\/sub> and SPMs such as RvE1, RvE2, RvD1, RvD4, and MaR1. Long-term intake amplified SPM accumulation, suggesting temporal regulation. These findings elucidate KO's potential mechanism in inflammation management through lipidome remodeling, supporting its application in functional foods for metabolic health enhancement.","29":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a leading cause of death and disability globally, often results in functional impairments due to complex pathological mechanisms and limited therapeutic options. Recently, astrocytes, the most abundant glia in the central nervous system, have been recognized as therapeutic targets for TBI due to their roles in neuroinflammation and neuroprotection. While NeuroD1-based gene therapy demonstrates therapeutic potential by reversing glial scar, suppressing neuroinflammation, and repairing brain tissue, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. To elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing using cortical stab injury mice of TBI to compare the effects of vehicle treatment with those of NeuroD1-based gene therapy. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals significant shifts in cellular composition and astrocyte subtypes. These changes involve upregulated synaptic assembly and myelination pathways alongside downregulated mitochondrial and metabolic functions in TBI mice. Conversely, NeuroD1-based gene therapy restores mitochondrial and metabolic functions and attenuates aberrant synaptic and myelination processes. This single-cell transcriptomic dataset provided a valuable resource for mechanistic and therapeutic research for TBI.","30":"People with HIV (PWH) on combination antiretroviral therapy have an elevated risk for aging-related non-AIDS comorbidities. We assess whether HIV infection accelerates biological aging in two independent cohorts of PWH using six organ-specific and three organism-wide aging clocks derived from plasma proteomics of healthy individuals. Proteomic age acceleration significantly correlates with DNA methylation age and is linked to comorbidities and mortality. HIV infection accelerates systemic biological aging, with Mendelian randomization demonstrating causality between organ aging and inflammatory or metabolic complications. Accelerated aging in PWH is further related to the total HIV reservoir, and specific antiretroviral drugs reduce age acceleration. These data reveal important causal effects between chronic HIV infection, antiretroviral medication, biological aging and age-associated diseases, highlighting targets for improving health span in PWH.","31":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is synthesized through both amidated salvage and deamidated pathways. Although NAD-producing enzymes are often overexpressed in cancer cells to meet the high metabolic demands of rapid proliferation and are considered oncogenic, we report that physiological levels of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (NAPRT), the first enzyme in the Preiss-Handler arm of the deamidated pathways, suppress tumorigenesis. We show that NAPRT is enriched in gut epithelial cells, where it sustains the NAD pool for an efficient response to stress-induced acute NAD depletion. Consequently, NAPRT deficiency impairs the activity of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases and DNA repair, sensitizes mice to chemical-induced colitis and tumorigenesis, as well as to age-associated spontaneous tumor development. Moreover, low NAPRT expression correlates with poor prognosis in several human cancer types. Thus, homeostatic levels of deamidated NAD biosynthesis contribute to tumor suppression, and boosting this pathway may offer a strategy for cancer prevention.","32":"Sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (sST) enables transcriptome-wide gene expression mapping but falls short of reaching the optical resolution (200-300\u2009nm) of imaging-based methods. Here, we present Seq-Scope-X (Seq-Scope-eXpanded), which empowers submicrometer-resolution Seq-Scope with tissue expansion to surpass this limitation. By physically enlarging tissues, Seq-Scope-X minimizes transcript diffusion effects and increases spatial feature density by an additional order of magnitude. In liver tissue, this approach resolves nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in nearly every single cell, uncovering widespread differences between nuclear and cytoplasmic transcriptome patterns. Independently confirmed by imaging-based methods, these results suggest that individual hepatocytes can dynamically switch their metabolic roles. Seq-Scope-X also works in brain and colon, and can be adapted for spatial proteomics, profiling hundreds of barcode-tagged antibody stains at microscopic resolutions in mouse spleens and human tonsils. Together, these findings establish Seq-Scope-X as a powerful platform for ultra-high-resolution whole-transcriptome and proteome profiling, expanding the spatial precision achievable for studying cellular architecture, function, and disease mechanisms.","33":"Frailty, characterized by diminished physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors, is a common geriatric syndrome associated with adverse health outcomes. While recent seminal studies have reported conflicting findings regarding taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid with antioxidant properties, and its relationship with aging, these discrepancies may reflect the heterogeneity of aging trajectories among older adults that chronological age alone fails to capture. Here, we propose that frailty status may better capture this heterogeneity and reveal associations between taurine and aging that are obscured when using age alone. We examined taurine and upstream metabolites in the taurine biosynthesis pathway in 146 community-dwelling adults aged 20-97 years, focusing on older adults (\u226569 years) stratified by frailty phenotype. We observed a non-monotonic relationship where taurine levels were highest in robust individuals, lowest in prefrail, and intermediate in frail groups. Analysis of the taurine biosynthesis pathway revealed distinct metabolic profiles across frailty states. Robust individuals demonstrated efficient pathway flux, while the prefrail group exhibited maximal metabolic disruption characterized by bottlenecks. Frail individuals showed persistent metabolic disruption but partial taurine restoration, suggesting compensatory mechanisms. Inflammatory marker associations varied by frailty status, with TNF-\u03b1 showing a significant negative correlation with taurine specifically in prefrail individuals. These findings demonstrate that frailty status reveals distinct shifts in taurine metabolism and immunological regulation not captured by chronological age alone, providing a more biologically meaningful framework for understanding taurine biology in aging populations.","34":"Obesity and type-2 diabetes, two interconnected and increasingly prevalent metabolic disorders, are associated with poor bone quality, higher fracture risk, and impaired fracture repair. The causes are not yet resolved but appear to relate to the impaired glucose homeostasis, altered bone material properties and remodeling, and compromised skeletal vascularization. Each of these features is impacted by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling, which led us to hypothesize that HIF pathway modulation might be an effective strategy to concomitantly improve energy metabolism and bone health in conditions of metabolic stress. Here, we evaluated whether pharmacological HIF activation using the HIF-prolyl-hydroxylase-domain enzyme (PHD) inhibitor FG-4592 (Roxadustat) could protect mice against the adverse skeletal and metabolic consequences of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. We found that systemic FG-4592 treatment effectively prevented HFD-triggered body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and peripheral fat accumulation, associated with globally increased energy expenditure. Concomitantly, FG-4592 administration prevented the skeletal vascular damage, marrow fat accumulation, and bone formation deficits that were caused by HFD. Moreover, the HIF-activating drug also improved glucose metabolism and bone regeneration in a model of compromised fracture repair associated with overnutrition. Specifically, short-term FG-4592 treatment during fracture recovery reduced the body weight and fat mass of obese mice, improved glucose tolerance, and enhanced the fracture bridging capacity, along with promoting callus vascularization. These findings demonstrate that systemic hypoxia signaling stimulation using PHD inhibitors alleviates both the metabolic and skeletal consequences of diet-induced obesity in mice, highlighting its potential as a dual-action therapeutic strategy for enhancing glucose homeostasis and bone health\/regeneration in disorders of obesity and metabolic dysfunction.","35":"Neurodegenerative disease profoundly affects structures and pathways responsible for memory, cognition, and higher-order processing. A foundational understanding of neuroanatomy and physiology is essential for recognizing how these disorders develop and how they are visualized with molecular imaging. Neurons, dendrites, axons, microtubules, and associated proteins, such as tau, form the structural basis for information transmission. Glial cells support neuronal health, regulate neurotransmission, maintain metabolic balance, and contribute to inflammatory responses that become dysregulated with aging. Brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and limbic system coordinate memory formation, emotional encoding, working memory, and spatial navigation. The physiology of memory relies on encoding, consolidation, storage, and retrieval processes driven by neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, glutamate, serotonin, and dopamine. Synaptic plasticity enables adaptive strengthening or weakening of neural connections, whereas age-related changes contribute to natural cognitive decline. This article reviews the neuroanatomy and cellular physiology underlying memory to help understand neurodegenerative patterns and their appearance on advanced imaging.","36":"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and one of the leading causes of death in adults age 65 y or older in the United States. AD presents with symptoms of cognitive impairment that worsen with disease progression, ultimately affecting an individual's functional abilities, independence, and overall health. Historically, treatment has relied on the mitigation of the adverse effects of the disease; however, the recent development of antiamyloid monoclonal antibodies allows for the targeting of pathologic factors that drive the progression of disease. Nuclear medicine has established itself as a useful tool in the evaluation of AD through the use of PET tracers, which target pathologic biomarkers such as amyloid-\u03b2 and tau proteins, as well as metabolic processes reflective of neurodegenerative damage. Amyloid-\u03b2 PET imaging and quantification have recently gained interest for their ability to more effectively diagnose AD and identify patients eligible for treatment with new antiamyloid therapies.","37":"Hyperlactatemia has been associated with poor outcomes in various clinical settings including liver transplantation (LT). However, the impact of intraoperative lactate levels and lactate clearance on long-term mortality in LT recipients remains unclear. We retrospectively reviewed data from 1,067 patients who underwent LT. All lactate data measured intraoperatively were used to calculate the time-weighted average lactate (TWAL) method. Lactate clearance was calculated as the difference between lactate levels immediately after reperfusion and at the end of surgery. Multivariable analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of mortality after LT. Higher lactate group showed significantly worse survival at 30-days, 1-year, and 3-years (P = 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively), and lactate clearance was significantly lower in non-survivors (P = 0.003, P = 0.003, and P = 0.002, respectively). Multivariable analyses revealed that the TWAL was independently associated with each mortality timepoint (hazard ratio [HR], 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-1.67; P < 0.001, HR, 1.29, 95% CI, 1.17-1.42; P < 0.001, HR, 1.20, 95% CI, 1.10-1.30; and P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, lactate clearance was also an independent predictor for each mortality timepoint (HR, 0.69, 95% CI, 0.60-0.80; P < 0.001, HR, 0.80, 95% CI, 0.73-0.88; P < 0.001, and HR, 0.83, 95% CI, 0.77-0.90; P < 0.001, respectively). Both intraoperative lactate level and lactate clearance were independently associated with mortality after LT. Intraoperative lactate monitoring may help predict both short- and long-term mortality in LT recipients.","38":"As it is a tumour-associated antigen in epithelial cells, research on claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2) has focused on its role as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancers and its part in maintaining tight junctions. We elucidate the role of trogocytosis-related CLDN18.2 in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression. We constructed humanised hCD34<sup>+<\/sup>, Trp53<sup>R172H<\/sup>Kras<sup>G12D<\/sup>Pdx1-cre (KPC), Cldn18.2 knockout (KO), and patient-derived xenograft\/organoid mouse models. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, single-cell RNA-sequencing and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) were performed. CLDN18.2<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells indicated poor pancreatic cancer prognosis and immunotherapeutic resistance. CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells acquired CLDN18.2 from tumour cells via trogocytosis, inhibiting their activation and cytotoxicity. \"Dressed\" CLDN18.2 suppressed glucose uptake, glycolysis and cytotoxicity of tumour-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Mechanically, trogocytosis-related CLDN18.2 induced GSK3\u03b2\/CK1\u03b1-mediated \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation, promoting \u03b2-catenin ubiquitination and proteasome degradation in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. CLDN18.2 interacted with \u03b2-catenin's N-terminal domain via its C-terminal domain, further strengthening the interaction between \u03b2-catenin and CK1\u03b1. Moreover, CLDN18.2<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells preferentially 'homed' to the bone marrow through the CXCL12\/CXCR4 axis, skewed haematopoietic stem cell myeloid differentiation and induced systemic immune senescence via IL1\u03b1. Notably, preclinical mouse studies showed PC18.1 peptide sensitised immunotherapy and suppressed PDAC progression by disrupting the CLDN18.2\/\u03b2-catenin interaction in CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells. Trogocytosis-related CLDN18.2 inhibited the glucose uptake, glycolysis and cytotoxicity of tumour-infiltrating CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells by promoting the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of \u03b2-catenin in PDAC. Therefore, targeting trogocytosis-related CLDN18.2<sup>+<\/sup>CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cells may be a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit PDAC progression.","39":"DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) based liquid embolic agents have revolutionized the endovascular treatment of high-flow intracranial vascular malformations but can be associated with systemic and metabolic complications. Extensive safety data exists regarding the rates of such complication in adults and older children. However, relatively little published data is available on the safety profile in neonates, infants, and toddlers, which may limit uptake in the treatment of young children. We hypothesized that complication rates related to the use of these agents in young children are relatively similar to those reported in older children or adults. A single-centre retrospective cohort study was undertaken of all paediatric neuro-interventional procedures utilizing DMSO-based liquid embolic agents in patients of age < 18 years at the time of their first procedure who underwent at least one embolization procedure between 1<sup>st<\/sup> July 2022 and 30<sup>th<\/sup> June 2025. The primary outcome was the rate of complications attributable to use of DMSO-based liquid embolic agents including systemic, metabolic, neurological, and technical complications. Subgroup analyses were performed comparing results between younger (neonates, infants, and toddlers: 0 days - 36 months) and older (3 - 18 years) age subgroups. A total of 66 embolization procedures were performed in 17 paediatric patients (female 6, male 11, age 2 days - 18 years, mean 4.1 years, median 2.0, SD 5.35). The most common indication for treatment was vein of Galen malformation (47 of 66 procedures, 71.2%), and 48 of 66 procedures (72.7%) were performed in the younger subgroup (0 days - 36 months). Complications attributable to use of DMSO-based liquid embolic agents occurred with 5 of 66 procedures (7.6%). Four complications occurred in the younger subgroup (4 of 48 procedures), but there was no statistically significant difference compared with the older subgroup (1 of 18 procedures) (p=0.22; Fishers exact test). These complications included one death, two transient neurological deficits, and two episodes of asymptomatic embolic migration to the lungs. DMSO-based liquid embolic agents had a reasonable safety profile in neonates, infants, and toddlers, that was comparable to published rates in older children and adults.","40":"The glymphatic system, essential for metabolic waste clearance and brain homeostasis, is vulnerable to disruption following traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is a pressing need for practical and robust methods to assess glymphatic function after TBI, as well as for other neurologic disorders. Diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) might have value in quantifying glymphatic dysfunction. Our aim was to consolidate existing evidence to determine differences in DTI-ALPS values between TBI patients and healthy controls (HCs). All studies utilizing the DTI-ALPS index and reporting its mean and standard deviation in both TBI patients and healthy controls were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to August 8, 2025. Eleven studies comprising 694 patients with TBI, and 503 HCs were included. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. Standardized mean differences (Hedges' g) were used as the effect size measure. Pooled correlations between DTI-ALPS indices and demographic variables were evaluated. Heterogeneity was assessed using Higgins' I<sup>2<\/sup> statistic. Subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify potential sources of heterogeneity, and publication bias was examined using funnel plots and Begg's test. DTI-ALPS values were found to be significantly reduced in TBI patients compared to HCs (Hedges' g = -0.77; 95% CI: -1.38 to -0.15; I<sup>2<\/sup>=93%). DTI-ALPS showed no significant correlation with age or Glasgow Coma Scale scores. Subgroup analyses revealed larger effect sizes in single-shell studies and those with higher methodological rigor. Meta-regression showed a larger decrease in DTI-ALPS values in TBI patients over time (\u03b2=-0.01, p=0.03). No substantial publication bias was detected (p=0.12). Our meta-analysis is limited by substantial heterogeneity and the small number of included studies. TBI is associated with significantly reduced DTI-ALPS values, with more prominent deteriorations over the long term, supporting its potential as a biomarker of glymphatic impairment. However, methodological heterogeneity emphasizes the need for standardized protocols and longitudinal studies to establish clinical utility.","41":"A man in his late 50s presented with muscle cramps due to severe hypomagnesaemia. Extensive evaluation established the diagnosis of adult-onset familial hypomagnesaemia with secondary hypocalcaemia (HOMG1, OMIM #602014). As expected, due to impaired gastrointestinal absorption, oral magnesium supplementation proved insufficient to maintain stable serum magnesium concentrations, leading to recurrent emergency department presentations and the need for alternative supplementation routes. Intravenous magnesium two times a week was effective for over 3 years, until device infections and venous occlusions rendered intravenous access unfeasible. Subcutaneous magnesium infusion provided an alternative, although local pain required concomitant anaesthetics, and recurrent allergic reactions to these agents introduced additional challenges. Hypomagnesaemia is a common clinical finding and often secondary to proton pump inhibitor or excessive alcohol use. This case illustrates a rare presentation of severe and relapsing hypomagnesaemia in adult-onset HOMG1, with an overview of the successes and complexities of long-term parenteral magnesium supplementation.","42":"Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS-1) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts the proximal mitochondrial phase of the urea cycle, resulting in impaired ureagenesis, hyperammonaemia and metabolic decompensation during the neonatal period. This condition is linked to significant neurological impairment and poses a considerable risk of mortality, especially in newborns. This case underscores the importance of recognising urgent clinical presentation and the intricate management challenges encountered in the treatment of early-onset CPS-1 deficiency.","43":"To evaluate emergency patient care from a chronophysiological perspective, examining circadian variations in symptom presentations and physiological parameters.Single-centre retrospective analysis. SETTING: Department of Emergency Medicine, Clinical Centre, University of P\u00e9cs, Hungary (August 2022 to August 2023). Patient data including symptom categories, time of presentation (divided into eight 3-hour intervals), sex and age were collected. A total of 32\u2009977 patient records were analysed. Symptoms were classified using the <i>International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision<\/i>. For hypertension, random proportionally stratified sampling was performed (n=120). Primary outcomes were the circadian distribution of emergency presentations across 14 symptom categories and their variation by time of day, age and sex. Secondary outcomes included diurnal variation in hypertension-related cases, examining blood pressure, pulse rate, triage time and medication use. Cardiovascular cases peaked between 09:00 and 12:00 (p<0.001), toxicological emergencies between 18:00 and 21:00 (p<0.001) and endocrine-metabolic cases between 12:00 and 15:00 (p<0.001). In hypertensive patients, the lowest systolic pressure occurred between 12:00 and 15:00 (p=0.037). More patients presented on weekdays than weekends (p=0.013). Symptom presentations in emergency care follow distinct circadian patterns, highlighting the influence of biological rhythms on clinical demand. Recognition of these temporal trends may support more effective ED scheduling and resource allocation.","44":"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in paediatric patients. Adult and murine studies have suggested a role for endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria in the development of MASLD, but there is incomplete and conflicting evidence for its role in adolescents. To determine if adolescents with biopsy-proven MASLD have elevated endotoxin activity and whether endotoxin markers are associated with liver histological features. Serum endotoxin core antibodies (EndoCab IgG), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), soluble CD14 (sCD14) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in adolescents with obesity and MASLD (n\u2009=\u200946), and control groups without MASLD with obesity (Ob, n\u2009=\u200928) or normal weight (NW, n\u2009=\u200934). Compared to the NW group, both the MASLD and Ob groups had higher EndoCab IgG (56%), LBP (33%) and CRP (11-fold), while sCD14 did not differ. LBP and CRP were positively correlated to trunk and total body fat (r\u2009=\u20090.45 and 0.64, respectively), and to one another (r\u2009=\u20090.42), all p\u2009<\u20090.001. None of the endotoxin markers varied between boys and girls, or with liver steatosis grade or fibrosis stage within the MASLD group. Serum markers of endotoxin activity and inflammation are increased in adolescents with obesity but are not further increased in patients with mild to moderate MASLD.","45":"To estimate hormone therapy (HT) use among women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and to explore whether HT initiation timing is associated with differential long-term health outcomes. Retrospective cohort study. Population-based using the South Korean National Health Insurance Service database. 105\u2009830 South Korean women from 2005 and 2015. Women with POI with ICD-10 code E283 in the database were compared to a 1:4 propensity score-based matching controls. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for major chronic diseases. The study compared 21\u2009166 women with POI and 84\u2009664 controls. POI was associated with higher risks of major chronic diseases, including thyroid disease, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Within the POI cohort, HT exposure was associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (IRR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76-0.88) and dyslipidaemia (IRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.84-0.91). In the landmark analysis, on-time HT initiation within 1\u2009year was associated with lower risks of thyroid disease (IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62-0.76), T2DM (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.93) and dyslipidaemia (IRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65-0.78) compared with delayed initiation. The current study suggests that an on-time HT initiation strategy within 1\u2009year of POI diagnosis is associated with more favourable long-term cardio metabolic outcomes, supporting the clinical importance of early management in POI.","46":"Human childbirth is uniquely challenging among primates, which has been attributed to evolutionary trade-offs between birthing large-brained infants and bipedal locomotion ('obstetrical dilemma'). Adapted for efficient upright walking and running, the human pelvis forms a rigid ring that leaves little leeway for parturition and causes a relatively high risk of obstructed labour. Static mechanics suggests that a wider pelvis increases the energy demands of the abductor muscles during locomotion. Recent empirical studies, however, have not observed a significant increase in whole-body locomotor costs in individuals with wider pelves. To investigate this discrepancy, we employed a detailed musculoskeletal model and predictive forward modelling to simulate human gait while systematically varying body dimensions beyond modern human variation. Our results confirm that a wider pelvis substantially increases abductor muscle energy demands and activation (\u00b1\u202f10% for \u00b1\u202f20% width change), consistent with predictions based on lever mechanics. However, during dynamic walking, these increased demands are offset by a redistribution of energy costs to other muscles, leading to only minimal increases in whole-body metabolic cost (\u00b1\u202f1% for \u00b1\u202f20% width change). In contrast, lower limb length shows a 2.5-fold greater effect on metabolic cost than pelvic width. These findings reconcile static mechanics predictions with whole-body measurements: while abductor muscle costs increase with pelvic width as predicted, these costs are compensated mainly at the organismal level. We propose that if locomotor costs constrained pelvic evolution, they likely operated through subsystem-level mechanisms, such as muscle-specific energetics and fatigue, rather than whole-body energy economy.","47":"Pyruvate, a C3 platform compound, has significant applications across multiple sectors, including bio-based materials (e.g., polylactic acid), pharmaceutical intermediates (such as L-alanine), and food additives. Biomanufacturing via microbial fermentation provides renewable feedstocks and cleaner processes compared to traditional petroleum-based methods. This study explores the extremophilic halophile Halomonas bluephagenesis TD01 as a chassis organism for pyruvate production. To enhance pyruvate synthesis, several engineering strategies were implemented, including blocking the primary carbon consumption pathway, eliminating pyruvate bypass degradation, reducing tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, removing the glycolic acid cycle, regulating transcription factors, and minimizing pyruvate reabsorption and utilization. The engineered H. bluephagenesis TD1.24 produced 39 g\/L pyruvate in a 50-h non-sterile fed-batch fermentation. Simultaneously, the high-pyruvate-producing strains showed improved conversion rate of PHB and efficient acetoin synthesis. H. bluephagenesis demonstrated robustness as a chassis for Next generation Industrial Biotechnology (NGIB), enabling the production of both its native and a broader range of biological products.","48":"Cross-feeding is a form of metabolic cooperation in microbial populations where one species or strain produces a byproduct that serves as a nutrient for another. This interaction can promote division of labor, resource efficiency, and species coexistence. The extent to which spatial heterogeneity and metabolite diffusion shape cross-feeding interactions is not yet well resolved. In this study, we examine the spatial dynamics of cross-feeding between two bacterial strains using a two-dimensional chemostat lattice model. Both strains are capable of growing on glucose and acetate, but differ in resource preference. One, which we term glucose specialist, primarily consumes glucose, while the other, which we term acetate specialist, primarily consumes acetate. Moreover, elevated acetate amount inhibits the growth of both strains. Metabolite dynamics are governed by reaction-diffusion equations, and bacterial motility is implemented through partially random local dispersal rules. Our simulations reveal that the emergence of traveling waves plays a critical role in enabling long-term coexistence of the two strains. Specifically, clusters of glucose specialists self-organize into wave-like structures that propagate toward regions of elevated acetate amount. These traveling waves suppress inhibitory acetate level ahead of the front, creating favorable conditions in their wake for the acetate specialists to grow. The resulting spatiotemporal patterns-characterized by merging wave fronts and sequential colonization-allow both strains to persist over the long term, despite competitive and inhibitory interactions. Mathematical analysis is used to support and interpret the simulation results. These findings demonstrate how spatial self-organization and reaction-diffusion dynamics can mediate coexistence in microbial cross-feeding systems, offering new insights into the ecological and evolutionary stability of microbial communities.","49":"Eastman TritanTM copolyester, a novel plastic used as a replacement for bisphenols and manufactured utilizing three monomers, can be released from products, potentially entering biological fluids, and could exert estrogenic activity. Since neutrophils are inflammatory cells that express hormone receptors, we hypothesized that Tritan compounds could modulate neutrophil metabolism and function. Human neutrophils from the blood of healthy male and female donors were exposed in vitro to Tritan monomers, alone or combined with pro-inflammatory cytokines, and assessed for viability, metabolism, surface marker expression, and antimicrobial functions. Tritan compounds did not affect neutrophil viability but increased metabolic activity under inflammatory conditions. The production of CCL4\/MIP-1\u03b2 was reduced, while CXCL8\/IL-8 was unchanged. Phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species production were altered in dose-dependent manner, with the effect more pronounced in male neutrophils at lower doses and female neutrophils at higher doses. The expression of CD11b and CD16, adhesion and functional markers, was also modulated by Tritan monomers. These results indicate that Tritan and its monomers can alter neutrophil phenotype and function, potentially impairing host defence or contributing to dysregulated inflammation. These findings raise concerns about the safety of Tritan as an alternative plasticizer. Further research is needed to better understand the potential health risks of Tritan and its monomers, to help develop or update evidence-based regulations that protect public health.","50":"Rice flour is primarily composed of starch and is widely used as an ingredient in processed foods. However, excessive consumption of white rice, the raw material for rice flour, induces a rapid postprandial glucose spike, increasing the risk of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this study, rice flour was biocatalytic modified by glycogen branching enzyme derived from Rhodothermus obamensis (RoGBE) to impart slowly digestible properties. The enzyme-modified rice flour exhibited a reduced molecular size distribution and degree of polymerization, together with an increased proportion of \u03b1-1,6 linkages. Notably, the content of highly branched \u03b1-limit dextrins produced by \u03b1-amylase was markedly elevated, leading to slow hydrolysis and sustained energy release with attenuated glucose spike at the in vitro and in vivo levels. In conclusion, the slowly digestible RoGBE-treated rice flour is a clean-label food that can be produced through a simple process without chemical treatment. In addition, no significant differences in structural and hydrolytic properties were observed between dry-milled and wet-milled rice flour after enzymatic modification. These results suggest the use of dry milling with lower wastewater and energy consumption together with a clean-label approach. Overall, RoGBE-treated rice flour produced from rice has the potential to be utilized as a functional food ingredient to prevent metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Furthermore, it can be used as a food additive to provide sustained energy to the body, thereby enhancing the added value and usability of rice flour.","51":"Infected wounds pose a significant clinical challenge due to persistent infection, chronic inflammation, insufficient angiogenesis, and compromised tissue regeneration. Nitric oxide (NO) has attracted considerable attention in infected wound healing recently. However, achieving microenvironment-responsive and sustained release of NO remains challenging. In this study, we develop a microenvironment-responsive sodium alginate (SAZA) hydrogel loaded with ZnO<sub>2<\/sub> nanoparticles (NPs) and L-arginine (L-Arg). In the acidic microenvironment of infected wounds, ZnO<sub>2<\/sub> NPs within SAZA hydrogel underwent hydrolysis to release H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> and Zn<sup>2+<\/sup>, and then H<sub>2<\/sub>O<sub>2<\/sub> reacted with L-Arg in a cascade reaction to generate NO, conferring both responsive effectiveness and prolonged treatment benefits. Furthermore, the increased membrane permeability induced by Zn<sup>2+<\/sup> facilitated the entry of NO into bacterial cells, promoting DNA damage and metabolic inhibition. Under this synergistic effect, SAZA hydrogel exhibited enhanced antibacterial activity. Meanwhile, SAZA hydrogel also facilitated cell migration and angiogenesis while demonstrating good biocompatibility. In vivo experiments further confirmed that SAZA hydrogel mitigated infection and inflammation in infected wounds of mice, and accelerated wound healing through enhanced angiogenesis and collagen deposition. By integrating strong antibacterial activity with improved tissue repair, this multifunctional hydrogel with NO sustained release offers a promising strategy for treating infected wounds.","52":"Natural polysaccharides sodium alginate (SA) and chitosan (CS) were used to fabricate electrosprayed CS-coated SA microspheres (core-shell structured; blank ones denoted as MP) for encapsulating ellagic acid (EA) and urolithins (Uro A, Uro B, Uro C, Iso A), addressing EA's low bioavailability and urolithin metabolic variability. With 1% SA, all microspheres showed uniform size (< 100\u202f\u03bcm), and the drug-loaded formulations achieved 60-88% encapsulation efficiency. FTIR confirmed successful drug embedding: SA (1613\u202fcm<sup>-1<\/sup>) and CS (1654\u202fcm<sup>-1<\/sup>) characteristic peaks changed vs. pure polysaccharides, and a faint, drug-specific peak at 1508\u202fcm<sup>-1<\/sup> (only in drug-loaded microspheres) indicated the presence of non-covalent physical interactions between components. TGA\/DTG showed enhanced thermal stability in drug-loaded microspheres: MP@EA had a higher T\u2098 (261\u202f\u00b0C) than MP (241\u202f\u00b0C). Higher SA content (1% to 2.0%) reduced T\u2098 (241\u202f\u2192\u202f224\u202f\u00b0C for MP; 261\u202f\u2192\u202f246\u202f\u00b0C for MP@EA), confirming drug-polymer interactions improved heat resistance. The antioxidant activity of all encapsulated drugs was reduced by approximately 25-45% compared with their corresponding free drugs, while in vitro digestion mitigated drug loss by 32-69% with intact structural integrity of the encapsulated system. Thus, CS-coated SA microspheres serve as an efficient polysaccharide carrier to protect bioactives during digestion, offering a novel strategy to address EA's low bioavailability and urolithin metabolic variability.","53":"The interaction between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), excess body weight, and epigenetic variation remains poorly understood. This study investigated the association between excess body weight and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from patients with SLE. In this cross-sectional study, 36 premenopausal women with SLE were classified as normal weight (NW,n\u202f=\u202f16) or excess body weight (EBW, n\u202f=\u202f20). Anthropometric, metabolic, dietary, and physical activity data were collected. Genome-wide DNA methylation in SAT was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. A total of 3783 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCpGs) were identified between groups, with 1165 hypermethylated and 2618 hypomethylated sites in EBW patients. DMCpGs were enriched in promoter and open sea regions and annotated to immune, inflammatory, and metabolic pathways. DNMT1 expression was higher in EBW patients. Excess body weight is associated with distinct DNA methylation patterns in SAT from patients with SLE. gov Identifier: NCT05097365.","54":"The zinc-to-copper ratio (Zn\/Cu) integrates the opposing redox and metabolic roles of zinc and copper and may offer additional value for stratifying glycemic risk in clinical practice. This study evaluated serum zinc, copper, and the Zn\/Cu ratio across the glycemic spectrum using a routine automated chemistry analyzer. In this cross-sectional study, 217 adults were categorized into control (n\u202f=\u202f78), impaired fasting glucose (n\u202f=\u202f60), insulin resistance (n\u202f=\u202f48), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; n\u202f=\u202f31) groups based on fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), using American Diabetes Association thresholds. Serum zinc and copper were measured on an ARCHITECT c16000 analyzer with validated colorimetric assays, and the Zn\/Cu ratio was calculated. Group comparisons used ANOVA; correlations with glycemic indices were assessed using Pearson's r and multivariable linear regression adjusted for age and sex. Discrimination of T2DM was evaluated via receiver operator characteristic analysis. Serum copper increased and the Zn\/Cu ratio decreased progressively from control to T2DM (p\u202f=\u202f0.0148 and p\u202f=\u202f0.0135, respectively), while zinc levels did not differ significantly between groups. Zn\/Cu showed negative correlations with fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR, and was independently associated with lower HOMA-IR in regression models (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u202f-\u202f6.81; 95% CI: -11.16 to\u202f-\u202f2.46). Zn\/Cu discriminated T2DM with an area under the curve of 0.675. The Zn\/Cu ratio, derived from routine clinical chemistry assays, reflects glycemic dysregulation and insulin resistance. It may serve as a low-cost, pragmatic adjunct to standard markers such as fasting glucose and HbA1c in clinical laboratories.","55":"To assess whether 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) response patterns define clinically meaningful phenotypes among women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and whether these phenotypes are associated with perinatal outcomes and persistent postpartum diabetes. This single-center ambispective cohort included women diagnosed with GDM by a 75-g OGTT at 24-28\u202fweeks' gestation (IADPSG) between January 2020 and May 2025. Women were classified as isolated fasting hyperglycemia (Group 1), isolated post-load hyperglycemia (Group 2), or combined hyperglycemia (Group 3). From\u202f\u2265\u202f12\u202fweeks postpartum onward, participants were recontacted for assessment of glycemic status, and outcomes were verified using available clinical records, laboratory results when available, and medication data. Among 251 women (mean age 31.4\u202fyears; mean BMI 32.5\u202fkg\/m<sup>2<\/sup>), insulin therapy was most frequent in Group 3 (27.4%; p\u202f<\u202f0.001), which also had higher HbA1c (p\u202f=\u202f0.011) and earlier delivery (p\u202f=\u202f0.008). Persistent postpartum diabetes occurred in 12%. In multivariable analyses, higher BMI and phenotypes incorporating fasting hyperglycemia (Groups 1\/3) were independently associated with persistent postpartum diabetes. OGTT pattern-based phenotyping differentiates GDM subgroups in routine care, with differences in metabolic severity, treatment need, selected perinatal indicators, and postpartum diabetes risk, supporting targeted antenatal management and postpartum follow-up.","56":"Metabolic disorders have been recognized as a major contributor to the occurrence and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Identifying novel therapeutic agents to ameliorate the progression of OA with metabolic disorder is crucial. In this study, we demonstrate that semaglutide (SG), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, exhibits strong chondroprotective effects in an OA mouse model with obesity, as evidenced by reduced pathological changes, including cartilage degeneration, osteophyte formation, synovial lesion, and pain sensitivity. A randomized pilot clinical study (ChiCTR2200066291) further supports these findings. By designing a precise diet-controlled setting to rule out the effect of appetite suppression and weight loss induced by SG, we demonstrate a weight loss-independent mechanism. Through regulating the \"GLP-1R-AMPK-PFKFB3\" axis, the SG reprograms chondrocyte metabolism profile from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation under inflammatory conditions, resulting in cartilage restoration.","57":"Milk-alkali syndrome is characterized by the triad of hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, and acute kidney injury resulting from excessive intake of calcium and absorbable alkali. Despite falling out of prominence with the advent of modern ulcer treatments, milk-alkali syndrome has experienced a resurgence with the widespread availability of over-the-counter calcium preparations, which now account for up to 10% of hypercalcemia cases. A 60-year-old man with multiple comorbidities presented to the emergency department with altered mental status after his scheduled kyphoplasty was canceled due to concerning neurological findings. Laboratory evaluation revealed severe hypercalcemia, marked metabolic alkalosis, and acute kidney injury. Further history revealed excessive antacid consumption for heartburn. The patient was diagnosed with milk-alkali syndrome, treated with intravenous fluids and calcitonin, and discharged home after 48 hours with complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Milk-alkali syndrome represents an increasingly recognized cause of severe hypercalcemia in the emergency setting. This case demonstrates the importance of thorough medication history, early recognition of the classic triad, and prompt initiation of conservative management. With the growing use of calcium-based, over-the-counter preparations, emergency physicians must maintain vigilance for this potentially serious but readily treatable condition.","58":"Hyperkalemic emergencies can present with weakness, paralysis, sensorimotor deficits, and potentially fatal cardiac conduction abnormalities even in the absence of an elevated serum potassium. Common antihypertensive medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, are associated with serum potassium elevations and can exacerbate hyperkalemia, especially in patients with renal impairment. We report a 49-year-old patient who presented to the emergency department six hours following an intentional ingestion of potassium supplements totaling 600 milliequivalents (mEq). The patient also reported chronic use of ibuprofen and losartan 50 mg. Symptoms on presentation included weakness, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Initial labs revealed a potassium > 10 mEq\/L which was beyond the upper limit of assay detection for metabolic testing. Calcium gluconate, insulin with dextrose, albuterol, sodium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, fluids, and furosemide were sequentially administered. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed tachycardia, a widened QRS complex without discernible P waves, and non-specific ST-segment changes. Following treatment, a repeat ECG demonstrated decreased heart rate, normal axis, and a decreased QT interval. Creatinine at presentation was 1.67 mg per deciliter (patient's baseline) with repeat labs revealing a potassium of 9.6 mEq\/L. Definitive treatment with placement of a central venous catheter for emergent dialysis was initiated. This case illustrates how a patient's regularly prescribed medication may complicate the management of an acute overdose. Prompt identification of a patient's medications and supplements may expedite potentially life-saving interventions in a hyperkalemic emergency.","59":"Pectus excavatum (PEX) is the most common congenital chest wall deformity, characterized by posterior depression of the sternum and lower costal margin. While often asymptomatic, severe PEX can lead to compression of the heart and great vessels, potentially causing right ventricular dysfunction, syncope, and other cardiovascular symptoms. Syncope due to right ventricle compression in PEX is rare but can significantly impact quality of life and may require surgical intervention. An 18-year-old female presented to the emergency department after an unwitnessed syncopal episode. The patient reported feeling lightheaded while showering, followed by collapse and brief loss of consciousness. Diagnostic testing revealed normal neurological and metabolic parameters including point-of-care glucose, electrocardiogram, serum troponin, electrolytes, and head computed tomography. Chest imaging showed severe PEX with concerns of right ventricular compression. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated normal cardiac function, and exercise stress testing showed no ischemic changes. Additional laboratory studies revealed iron deficiency anemia. This case underscores the potential for PEX to cause distorted cardiac morphology, including right ventricular compression, which can lead to syncope in severe cases. The absence of cardiac ischemia, arrhythmias, or metabolic derangement suggests postural changes compounded by undiagnosed anemia and underlying PEX as the most likely cause of this patient's syncope. Given the patient's symptoms and anatomical findings, referral for surgical evaluation was made to discuss definitive management options. This case highlights the importance of considering structural chest wall abnormalities in the differential diagnosis of syncopal events, particularly when standard causes are excluded.","60":"Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common causes of low back and leg pain. While mechanical and degenerative factors have long been considered the main contributors, persistent or recurrent symptoms in many patients suggest additional biological mechanisms. Recent research has highlighted the microbiome as a potential modulator of inflammation, immune response, and pain sensitization, introducing the \"gut-spine axis\" concept. This scoping review summarizes the current evidence on the role of both gut and local disc microbiota in LDH. A systematic search of PubMed\/MEDLINE and Scopus was conducted up to June 2025, following PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Twenty-six studies were included, encompassing preclinical and clinical investigations. Animal models showed that LDH may alter gut microbial composition and that microbiome-targeted interventions can reduce inflammation, neuroinflammatory signaling, and pain sensitivity. In human studies, low-virulence bacteria, particularly Cutibacterium acnes, were frequently detected in surgically excised intervertebral discs, although results were inconsistent due to methodological heterogeneity and potential contamination. Some studies reported associations between bacterial colonization and Modic changes, disc height loss, or chronic pain. Additionally, genetic and metabolomic data suggest that gut dysbiosis and related microbial metabolites may influence systemic immune and metabolic pathways implicated in disc degeneration and pain perception. Overall, the current evidence suggests the biological plausibility of microbiome involvement in LDH pathophysiology, acting through both systemic and local mechanisms. However, the available data remain preliminary, and no mechanistic study has confirmed the observed correlations to date. Further standardized, contamination-aware studies are required to clarify causality and explore microbiome-targeted therapeutic strategies.","61":"Cobalt is a critical raw material for consumer electronic products such as electric vehicles and mobile communication devices. Currently, its recovery rate remains relatively low, resulting in a large amount of waste cobalt entering soil and groundwater environments, which poses a potential threat to human health. Previous studies have mostly focused on the effects of acute cobalt exposure. However, the in vivo metabolic mechanism of long-term low-dose cobalt exposure remains unclear, and the long-term toxic effects of cobalt on the heart await further investigation. Based on the existing model framework, this study constructed a cobalt Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model incorporating a heart compartment, filling the research gap in this field. Meanwhile, the study calibrated the parameters of the PBPK model by integrating the specific exposure scenarios and dietary exposure characteristics of the Chinese population, and conducted model evaluation and evaluation using epidemiological data of the Chinese population. With the help of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technology, this study conducted an in-depth analysis of the inter-individual exposure and metabolic characteristics. The results showed that the deviation between the cobalt concentrations in blood, urine, liver, kidneys, and heart of the Chinese population predicted by the model and the measured values was basically controlled within a 2-fold range. The cobalt PBPK model constructed in this study provides a key tool for the accurate risk assessment and practical application of cobalt exposure in the Chinese population, and also offers a referable research paradigm for accurate risk assessment under the specific characteristics of different ethnic groups.","62":"Growth hormone (GH) influences follicular development mainly by stimulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which acts systemically and locally within the ovary. However, the metabolic profile of follicular fluid (FF) in mares, particularly markers such as fructosamine (FRUCT), an indicator of glucose metabolism, remains poorly characterized. This study aimed to evaluate GH, IGF-1, and FRUCT concentrations in plasma and FF and their variation across follicle sizes. Sixty ovaries were collected during the breeding season from 30 clinically normal mares raised for meat production. Blood samples were obtained prior to slaughter. Follicles were classified as small (20-30 mm), medium (31-40 mm), and large (\u226541 mm), and FF was aspirated individually. GH was measured by enzyme immunoassay, IGF-1 by ELISA, and FRUCT by spectrophotometry. GH concentrations did not differ significantly between plasma and FF across follicle sizes. IGF-1 remained low in small and medium follicles but increased in large preovulatory follicles (p < 0.05). FRUCT concentrations in FF progressively rose with follicular development and were higher than plasma values (p < 0.05). IGF-1 and FRUCT were positively correlated (r = 0.65; p < 0.05). These findings suggest that IGF-1 plays a role in final follicular maturation, while FRUCT accumulation reflects enhanced local carbohydrate metabolism during follicular growth. Moreover, the positive correlation between IGF-1 and FRUCT indicates a potential link between metabolic activity and growth signaling within the follicular microenvironment.","63":"This investigation elucidated how depth- and season-dependent environmental gradients shape microbial community composition, metabolic potential, and carbon sequestration pathways in the Eastern Arabian Sea (EAS). The study encompassed six stations (L1-L6) spanning coastal to offshore regimes, three depth zones (surface, 200\u00a0m, and 1000\u00a0m), and three monsoonal phases: Spring Inter-Monsoon (SIM), Summer Monsoon (SM), and Winter Monsoon (WM). A total of 10,500 taxa were identified across all samples. Alpha-diversity indices showed peak diversity during the SM and SIM periods. Across all depths, Pseudomonadota (53.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.2%) remained the dominant phylum, underscoring its broad ecological adaptability. Cyanobacteria (31.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019%) were abundant in surface waters during SIM and WM, but declined sharply with depth (<2%), where Actinomycetota dominated (25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016%), highlighting strong vertical niche portioning. Distinct seasonal restructuring was evident, particularly during the SM, when upwelling-driven nutrient enrichment resulted in a marked decline in Cyanobacteria and a concomitant increase in copiotrophic taxa such as Rhodobacterales, Flavobacteriales, Pseudomonadales, and Oceanospirillales, indicative of intensified heterotrophic processing of organic matter. In contrast, oligotrophic taxa (Pelagibacterales, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus) prevailed during SIM and WM, suggesting nutrient-limited and microbially driven carbon cycling. Remarkably, even deep-water communities (200-1000\u00a0m) exhibited significant seasonal restructuring (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), with Alteromonadales and Oceanospirillales enriched during SM and Sphingomonadales and Rhodobacterales dominating during WM, indicating active coupling between surface productivity and deep microbial assemblages. Functional analyses revealed pronounced depth-dependent stratification of metabolic potential (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reflecting shifts from growth-oriented processes in surface waters to adaptive and recycling strategies at depth. Collectively, these findings reveal robust monsoon-driven and depth-stratified microbial dynamics in the EAS and provide novel evidence inferred based on microbial community structure and functional potential that both the Biological Carbon Pump and the Microbial Carbon Pump operate concurrently across this climatically sensitive and highly productive region.","64":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality, characterized by poor prognosis due to its high proliferative and invasive potential. Tumor metabolic reprogramming, particularly involving glucose metabolism, is essential for tumor survival. This study investigates the role of the Hippo pathway effector transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in regulating gluconeogenesis and promoting tumorigenesis in HCC. TAZ expression in HCC was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas data and validated in clinical samples and cell lines. TAZ was overexpressed or silenced in HCC cell lines to evaluate its effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. The expression and prognostic relevance of the gluconeogenesis-related genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) were examined, along with their correlation with TAZ expression. Tumor growth was assessed in nude mice. Interactions between TAZ and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were investigated using co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. TAZ was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. TAZ overexpression enhanced proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and promoted migration and invasion. In contrast, PCK1 and G6PC were downregulated in HCC and showed a negative correlation with TAZ expression. TAZ modulates gluconeogenesis and accelerates tumor growth, whereas its knockdown attenuates tumor progression. TAZ interacts with GR, suppressing its transcriptional activity on gluconeogenic gene promoters.","65":"Circadian disruption has been linked to adverse metabolic health. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to circadian disruptors, such as delayed sleep onset and social jetlag, which may have sex-specific effects. However, evidence linking these disruptors with circadian gene expression and subsequent cardiometabolic risk remains limited. Our study included 203 adolescents (53% females, median age 13.6 years) from the ELEMENT cohort in Mexico City. Sleep was assessed via 7-day wrist actigraphy. A fasting venipuncture blood sample was collected between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. RNA was isolated from blood leukocytes and sequenced to determine the relative expression of genes. We conducted differential gene expression analysis for 12 core clock genes in relation to sleep midpoint and social jetlag, adjusting for sleep duration and other potential confounders. We further evaluated how circadian gene expression associated with changes in adiposity, glucose metabolism, blood pressure, and lipid profiles over two years using linear regression. Later sleep midpoint (per 1-h increase) was associated with reduced mid-morning expression of four circadian genes: RORA (log2 fold change [LFC]: -0.190; P value: 0.001), RORC (LFC: -0.147; P value: 0.039), CLOCK (LFC: -0.141; P value: 0.019), and NR1D2 (LFC: -0.093; P value: 0.029). Additionally, expression levels of several clock genes (CRY1, NR1D2, BMAL1, and PER1-3) were associated with changes in metabolic biomarkers over two years in sex-specific patterns. For instance, NR1D2 showed a negative association with fasting glucose among females (\u03b2: -0.0012; P value: 0.020), while demonstrating positive associations with LDL cholesterol (\u03b2: 0.0023; P value: 0.002) and total cholesterol (\u03b2: 0.0016; P value: 0.028) among males. Expression of core clock genes was linked to circadian disruption and changes in cardiometabolic risk factors in a sex-specific manner among adolescents. Our findings provide novel insights into potential biological mechanisms underlying associations of circadian disruption with cardiometabolic health.","66":"No abstract available","67":"The individual's physiological system needs to function effectively for a person to maintain life in good health. Deficiency of vitamins and minerals and a structured approach to life tend to trigger variations in the quantity of biological substances, which include hormonal substances, proteins, and neurotransmitters, and threaten the well-being of humans. The most common and the most fundamental catecholamine neurotransmitter present throughout the brain and nervous system is dopamine. The primary nervous system, kidneys, the hormone-sensitive, cardiac, and metabolic functions of humans have each been controlled by how much it is in the body's tissues. Consequently, it would be desirable to come up with an exceptionally sensitive, precise and productive approach that allows for a quick determination of Dopamine levels. Here, we have defined a novel design of Radial Petal-Loop Pattern Refractive Index Biosensor (RPLPRIB) for measurements of dopamine components like Dn1, Dn2, Dn3, Dn4, and Dn5, with refractive index values of 1.256, 1.267, 1.289, 1.291, and 1.309. This structure's petal rings possess a greater efficient area of surface for substrate binding, which enabled greater numbers of dopamine receptors for interaction at the same time, therefore reducing the limit of detection. The outcomes of the RPLPRIB show substantial sensitivity of 1666.66\u00a0nm\/RIU, and substantial limits of detection 0.000190 RIU, for the concentrations of Dn5 and Dn3, respectively. The substantial quality factor values of 2077.66 and the sensor range value of 2108.78 RIU have been achieved for the concentration of Dn4. The machine learning approach also shows a substantial R-square value of 0.991156 with a low mean-square error. The defined idea represents suitable results that can perfectly help to determine dopamine.","68":"Heavy metal contamination has become a critical global environmental issue due to the widespread industrial activities and urbanization, posing serious risks to human health and ecosystems. Conventional methods of heavy metal remediation, such as physical and chemical treatments, often suffer from high costs, inefficiency, and secondary environmental damage. In contrast, bioremediation using humus-reducing bacteria (HRB) offers an environmentally sustainable and economically viable alternative. HRBs utilize mechanisms like biosorption, biomineralization, and electron transfer to immobilize or detoxify heavy metals, including lead (Pb\u00b2\u207a), cadmium (Cd\u00b2\u207a), and mercury (Hg\u00b2\u207a), in contaminated environments. This review examines the biochemical and ecological roles of HRBs in the bioremediation of heavy metals, with a focus on their metabolic pathways, microbial species involved, and factors influencing their efficiency. The challenges and limitations of HRB-based remediation, including environmental conditions, microbial community dynamics, and redox sensitivity, are also discussed. Future perspectives are provided on integrating HRBs with other bioremediation strategies, such as phytoremediation and advanced nanomaterials, to enhance the efficiency and scalability of metal detoxification processes.","69":"Androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) plays a crucial role in the malignant progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Current research has demonstrated that the development of novel AR-V7 degraders holds broad prospects and is expected to serve as a clinical therapeutic regimen for this disease. In the present work, we utilized structural analogs of enzalutamide to conjugate a silicon-containing hydrophobic tag (SiHyT) moiety via Click chemistry, achieving the selective degradation of the androgen receptor (AR) and AR-V7. Mechanistic studies revealed that the degrader disrupted the interactions between AR\/AR-V7 and HSP90. This disruption further prompted the E3 ubiquitin ligase helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF) to recognize AR and AR-V7, followed by their ubiquitination and degradation in CRPC cell lines. Additionally, the active compound exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties and metabolic profiles. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, this degrader displayed more potent activity than enzalutamide in inhibiting the proliferation and migration of CRPC cells. This study expands the application scope of the silicon-containing hydrophobic tag (SiHyT) strategy and provides an alternative design concept for the development of drugs targeting the degradation of AR\/AR-V7 in the treatment of CRPC.","70":"Sevoflurane is an inhalation anesthetic, which is widely favored by anesthesiologists in modern clinical practice. It is reported that sevoflurane readily degrades under certain conditions. Forced degradation studies are essential for elucidating its degradation profile under stressed conditions, as recommended by the ICH guidelines. This study systematically assessed the impact of temperature, light, oxidation, and hydrolysis on sevoflurane stability through forced degradation studies. The results indicated that temperature was identified as the primary trigger for degradation, leading to the formation of four degradation products (DPs) (including the pharmacopeial-known Impurity C and three novel sevoflurane degradants H, I, and J) at 60\u2103 and 95\u2103. Light, oxidation, and hydrolysis had no significant effect under the tested conditions. The structures of all DPs were confirmed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Capitalizing on the inherent quantitative proficiency of this technique, we subsequently employed quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (qHNMR) to determine the relative contents of these four DPs, which can further elucidate the degradation profile of sevoflurane. In silico toxicity and metabolic behavior of them were assessed by Derek Nexus and Meteor Nexus software, respectively. DPs H-J exhibited potential skin irritation\/corrosion and sensitization effects across species, potentially attributable to alkyl aldehyde functional groups. All of our efforts are expected to provide guidance for the quality control and optimal storage of sevoflurane.","71":"The limited understanding of microbial assembly mechanisms in tidal flow constructed wetlands (TFCW) hinders the steering of microbiome for the pollutant removal and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. In this study, TFCW with different flooding and draining (F\/D) durations (TFCW1: 22\u00a0h\/2\u00a0h; TFCW2: 21\u00a0h\/3\u00a0h; TFCW3: 20\u00a0h\/4\u00a0h; TFCW4: 19\u00a0h\/5\u00a0h) were established to investigate nitrogen removal, GHG mitigation and microbial metabolic mechanisms for treating polluted surface water. A moderately shortened flooding period (20\u00a0h\/4\u00a0h) reconfigured the core microbiome, resulting in an 90% total nitrogen removal and a 107\u00a0mg CO<sub>2<\/sub>-eq\/m<sup>2<\/sup>\/h global warming potential. This regime intensified habitat heterogeneity, fostering a complex and stable co-occurrence network. Structurally, this ecological restructuring enriched keystone taxa such as Nitrospira, Thauera, Candidatus Brocadia, facilitating nitrogen synergistic transformation. The structured microbial cooperation suppressed nitrous oxide production by promoting the complete reduction of nitrogen intermediates, while the draining period facilitated methane oxidation. Our findings elucidate a core ecological strategy whereby microbial communities adapt to hydraulic regime by restructuring interactions to maintain ecosystem functionality. Collectively, these findings offer guidance for the integrated optimization of GHG control in constructed wetlands.","72":"Deteriorating environmental quality, significantly driven by the release of untreated industrial effluent, jeopardizes water ecosystems and threatens human health. Conventional treatment methods often struggle to efficiently remove such complex effluents. This paper proposed a novel fungal-bacterial-algal (FBA) symbiotic system capable of simultaneously and efficiently removing nitrate (NO<sub>3<\/sub><sup>-<\/sup>-N), Zn<sup>2+<\/sup>, and Cu<sup>2+<\/sup> from industrial wastewater. By optimizing the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, pH, and hydraulic retention time, the system demonstrated outstanding removal performance even under heavy metal stress conditions. Product metabolism analysis indicates synergistic enhancement of microbial activity within the fungal-algal symbiosis. Precipitation characterisation demonstrated that FBA achieves heavy metal immobilization and removal through biomineralization and adsorption mechanisms. Microbial community and gene prediction analyses revealed interspecies functional synergistic mechanisms. This study provides an efficient and sustainable solution for treating complexly polluted industrial wastewater.","73":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) displays mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by disrupted redox homeostasis and cristae disorganization, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. We reveal that Src kinase phosphorylates prohibitin 2 (PHB2) at tyrosines Y34 and Y77 under oxidative stress, disrupting its interaction with cardiolipin and triggering PHB1\/2 complex disassembly. This event activates the mitochondrial protease OMA1, promoting excessive cleavage of the cristae-shaping protein OPA1, leading to severe cristae remodeling. Consequent impairment of electron transport chain supercomplexes decreases NAD+\/NADH ratio and complex I\/II activities, creating conditions that promote enhanced electron leakage and oxidative stress. This mitochondrial dysfunction drives a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis, promoting tumor growth in xenograft models. Phosphomimetic PHB2 mutants (Y34E\/Y77E) exacerbate these effects, whereas phosphorylation-resistant mutants (Y34F\/Y77F) restore cristae integrity, normalize redox balance, and suppress tumor progression. Our findings establish Src-mediated PHB2 phosphorylation as a redox-sensitive molecular switch that drives HCC metabolic reprogramming by disrupting the PHB2-cardiolipin cristae axis. This phosphorylation event represents a targetable vulnerability for this malignancy with limited treatment options.","74":"This study aimed to evaluate the potential of fermented sweet potato residue (FSPR) as a partial substitute for corn in goose diets, determine its optimal inclusion level, and assess its effects on intestinal morphology, immune status, and cecal microbiota. A 42-day feeding trial was conducted with 144 twenty-eight-day-old male Sichuan white geese randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments: a corn-soybean meal basal diet (CON) and three test diets replacing corn with 5%, 8%, or 12% of the corn with FSPR on a dry matter basis. Growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, serum biochemistry, intestinal morphology, and cecal microbiota were comprehensively assessed. Dietary FSPR inclusion induced a significant, dose-dependent reduction in average daily feed intake (P < 0.001). However, feed conversion ratio was linearly improved (P < 0.001), which compensated for the reduced intake and sustained growth performance. Despite reduced intake, the 8% FSPR group achieved the highest final body weight, and the feed conversion ratio was significantly improved in the 8% and 12% FSPR groups (P < 0.001). Additionally, FSPR improved meat quality by maintaining higher postmortem thigh muscle pH. Systemically, supplementation enhanced immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG) and anti-inflammatory IL-10 without inducing pro-inflammatory markers. Ileal morphology was optimized, evidenced by a significantly increased villus height-to-crypt depth ratio (P < 0.001). Cecal microbiota analysis revealed that FSPR enriched beneficial taxa (e.g., Phocaeicola, Lachnospiraceae), enhanced microbial diversity, and upregulated metabolic pathways for carbohydrate and amino acid biosynthesis. In conclusion, FSPR effectively replaces corn in goose diets, enhancing feed efficiency, meat quality, and immunity, likely associated with through gut microbiota modulation, with 8% identified as the optimal inclusion level.","75":"Leptomeningeal seeding (LMS) via cerebrospinal fluid is a common and often fatal progression in medulloblastoma (MB), significantly worsening prognosis. However, its molecular drivers are poorly understood, and effective treatments remain limited. This study aimed to establish a physiologically relevant MB LMS model and identify novel therapeutic targets through detailed characterization of seeding cell biology. Using three rounds of serial orthotopic xenograft transplantation and in vivo selection, we isolated distinct seeding (S3) and non-seeding (N3) MB cell populations. Functional and transcriptomic analyses revealed unique phenotypes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Based on DEGs, we screened inhibitors and assessed the therapeutic efficacy of the HSP70 inhibitor VER155008, alone and with chemotherapeutics (ifosfamide or cisplatin), both in vitro and in a preclinical LMS mouse model established by cerebellar implantation of S3 cells. S3 cells showed slower proliferation, altered migration behavior, and increased adhesion to collagen IV versus N3 cells. Transcriptomic profiling identified HSP70 as the most upregulated gene in S3 cells, with strong enrichment in metabolic pathways. Among six candidate compounds, VER155008 most effectively suppressed S3 cell viability. In vitro, VER155008 combined with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (active ifosfamide metabolite) produced a synergistic antitumor effect. This synergy was confirmed in vivo, where VER155008 with ifosfamide significantly reduced spinal LMS. These findings highlight HSP70 as a promising therapeutic target for MB LMS. The observed synergy between VER155008 and ifosfamide supports a selective combination strategy, offering a novel therapeutic avenue to improve outcomes in patients with leptomeningeal dissemination of MB.","76":"In vitro embryo culture often leads to developmental arrest. The maternal-to-zygotic (MZT) transition, involving maternal mRNA clearance and zygotic genome activation (ZGA), is a critical step in early embryogenesis. Although major epigenetic regulators have been identified, the role of lactate-derived histone lactylation in early embryos remains unclear. Here, we used goat MII oocytes, in vivo-derived 8-cell embryos, and in vitro-cultured 8-cell embryos as models to systematically compare transcriptional, epigenetic, and chromatin accessibility differences through integrative multi-omics approaches, including RNA sequencing, cleavage under targets and tagmentation for H3K23 lactylation, and immunofluorescence staining. Our results revealed that in vitro 8-cell embryos exhibited pronounced abnormalities in global transcription, key splicing factor expression, and chromatin accessibility. Notably, H3K23 lactylation levels were significantly reduced, associated with downregulation of metabolic genes. Functional validation using mouse embryos treated with an LDH inhibitor confirmed that reduced H3K23la led to decreased blastocyst formation, accompanied by CDK9 downregulation, consistent with impaired transcriptional activation during MZT. Collectively, these findings indicate that aberrant histone lactylation contributes to developmental arrest in in vitro-cultured embryos and highlight the critical role of the metabolism-epigenetic axis in early embryonic development, providing theoretical and experimental insights for optimizing culture systems and improving assisted reproductive technology outcomes.","77":"The Saint Peter Saint Paul archipelago (SPSPA) is situated in the central Equatorial Atlantic, approximately 1000\u00a0km from the northeastern coast of Brazil. A small population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) exhibits strong site fidelity to the remote archipelago. As apex predators, these dolphins can act as sentinels for the transport and bioaccumulation of organohalogen compounds in isolated marine environments. Remote biopsies were collected from nine individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a09) to investigate pollutant exposure. Blubber samples were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and naturally produced methoxylated organobromines (MeO-BDEs), using gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detection or mass spectrometry. Skin samples were analyzed in an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer. The profile of the chemical markers observed in these bottlenose dolphins was dominated by high molecular weight PCBs and high \u03b4<sup>13<\/sup>C, similar to coastal dolphin species. Atmospheric transport, adsorption to benthic substrates, and species-specific metabolic capacity possibly shape contaminant accumulation in this population. Naturally produced MeO-BDEs and carbon ratios suggest low oceanic-coastal dispersal of dolphins. These findings suggest the efficient transport of man-made pollutants to isolated locations and the key role of apex predators, such as bottlenose dolphins, as POPs reservoirs in oceanic zones.","78":"Sepsis is a serious condition characterized by hyperinflammation, often leading to organ dysfunction and mortality. Currently employed drugs are non-specific and lead to severe side effects. Hence, there is a need to search for patient-specific drugs targeting hyperinflammation. An in-silico analysis of multiple GEO datasets [GSE63311, GSE95233, and GSE28750] to identify differentially expressed genes [DEGs] in sepsis was performed. In-silico tools, including hub gene identification using Cytoscape, protein-protein interaction [PPI] network analysis using STRING, network analysis and functional enrichment, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, and gene ontology, were performed. Molecular docking was performed to assess the interactions between the ligand and target protein. Furthermore, we performed an ex-vivo study by challenging neutrophils from healthy volunteers and sepsis patients with and without E. coli and S. aureus, involving free radical formation, NO generation, and neutrophil extracellular traps [NETs] formation in the presence or absence of Resveratrol [RSV]. Nine potential hub genes, namely S100A12, S100A9, S100A8, HK3, HP, CD177, MCEMP1, ARG1, and ANXA3, having roles in pro-inflammatory, immune regulation, and metabolic processes, were identified as DEGs. PPI networks generated using the Cytoscape CytoHubba plugin identified these genes as central nodes, critical for sepsis progression. Molecular docking studies confirmed the binding affinity of RSV with S100A12. The free radical and NO generations, NETs release, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation from human neutrophils were significantly attenuated in the presence of RSV. The present study identified S100A12 as a potential therapeutic target for RSV to attenuate neutrophil-driven hyperinflammation in sepsis. This revealed the therapeutic potential of RSV in combating sepsis.","79":"The molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) to chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain poorly defined. In this study, a murine IRI model was established by bilateral renal pedicle clamping. Kidney tissues harvested on postoperative day 2 (IRI-2d, acute phase) and day 28 (IRI-28d, chronic phase) were analyzed using 4D label-free quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS). A total of 5351 proteins were identified, among which 910 and 329 were differentially expressed in the IRI-2d and IRI-28d groups, respectively, compared with sham controls. Enrichment analyses revealed consistent suppression of amino acid and lipid metabolic pathways during the acute phase, whereas inflammatory pathways, particularly complement and coagulation cascades, were robustly activated. By day 28, metabolic suppression persisted, while inflammatory activity had declined below baseline levels. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis further demonstrated strong associations between metabolic pathways and the acute and chronic stages of IRI, highlighting glycine, serine and threonine metabolism pathways may be a key driver in these stages, and identified Sarcosine Dehydrogenase (Sardh), serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (Shmt1), and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (Shmt2) as core hub proteins throughout the phase. Collectively, these findings delineate the dynamic proteomic landscape following renal IRI, underscore the divergent roles of metabolism and inflammation across disease stages, and provide a framework for developing stage-specific and precision kidney-protective strategies.","80":"Research has demonstrated that solid-state fermentation of foxtail millet with Pleurotus geesteranus can enhance its nutritional value and improve its antioxidant properties. However, studies exploring the changes in metabolites and metabolic pathways during fermentation are lacking. Untargeted metabolomics approaches can be used to reveal alterations in metabolites and metabolic pathways during foxtail millet fermentation. In this study, 584 differential secondary metabolites were identified, including 198 lipids, 111 organic compounds, 105 organic acids, and 45 benzenoids. Among these differential metabolites, 371 were upregulated, and 213 were downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis of the differential pathways revealed that they were primarily enriched in amino acid metabolism, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism, with amino acid metabolism being the most significantly enriched. Taken together, these findings provide a foundation for deeper understanding of the nutritional and bioactive components of fermented foxtail millet.","81":"To review the role of lower-body skeletal muscle non-weight-bearing simple resistance activities (SRAs), soleus push-ups (SPUs), and stretching exercises (SEs) in improving glycemic control and metabolic\/circulatory outcomes in those individuals who cannot do weight-bearing aerobic exercises due to musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory and other reasons. We conducted a narrative review of randomized controlled trials, prospective cohorts, and pilot interventions identified through searches of PubMed\/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, and ScienceDirect. We examined non-weight-bearing SRAs, SPUs, and SEs, focusing on pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical outcomes. Moderate lower-body strength is associated with 32-35% lower type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.94). Interrupting prolonged sitting with 3-min SRAs every 30\u00a0min reduces insulin response by 26%. SPUs-sustained, seated plantarflexion contractions-reduce postprandial glucose by 39-52% and insulin response by 60% during oral glucose tolerance tests. Passive SE for 40\u00a0min acutely lowered blood glucose by 24-28\u00a0mg\/dL, chronically improves femoral blood flow by 30% and flow-mediated dilation by 25%. Benefits are likely mediated through AMPK-dependent GLUT4 translocation, myokine secretion, and improved endothelial function. Lower-body SRAs, SPUs, and SEs are simple interventions that can be performed while seated and have the potential to significantly improve glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity, and vascular function in populations unable to engage in traditional weight-bearing aerobic exercise. Integration into clinical practice could provide cost-effective tools for the prevention and management of T2D. Finally, the effects of these exercises should be evaluated in long-term studies to determine their impact on glycaemic control and cardiovascular protection.","82":"The sipunculid worm Sipunculus nudus is a dioecious marine invertebrate with ecological and aquaculture importance. To investigate the metabolic features underlying gamete specialization and thermal response, we performed untargeted metabolomic analysis of spermatozeugmata and oocytes under control conditions, as well as oocytes exposed to acute heat stress (37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h; n\u00a0=\u00a06 males, 6 females, and 4 heat-stressed females) using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Combined multivariate and univariate statistical analyses, applied with fold-change and significance thresholds, revealed 894 putatively annotated metabolites that differed between oocytes and spermatozeugmata, and 1749 that changed significantly under heat stress. Oocytes were enriched in lipid species (e.g., phospholipids such as PI and LPC) and nucleotide derivatives (e.g., putatively annotated uridine monophosphate, deoxynucleosides), whereas spermatozeugmata showed higher levels of lipids (e.g., PE and PC species), amino acid derivatives (e.g., putatively annotated N-acetyl-DL-serine), and small peptides. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that metabolites mapped to neurotransmitter and energy metabolism pathways were more prominent in oocytes, while metabolites associated with antioxidant and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways were comparatively enriched in spermatozeugmata. Under heat stress, oocytes exhibited significant metabolic changes, with increased organic acids and lipid metabolites (fatty acids and glycerophospholipids) and decreased nucleotide- and amino acid-related compounds. Most KEGG-mapped metabolic pathways showed an overall reduction in associated metabolites, including amino sugar, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism, whereas metabolites mapped to Fc epsilon RI signaling and bile secretion KEGG pathways were relatively enriched. This study provides the first comprehensive metabolomic profile of S. nudus germ cells, revealing sex-specific metabolic patterns and heat-induced reprogramming of oocyte metabolism. These findings enhance our understanding of gamete physiology and acute thermal stress responses in marine invertebrates and may contribute to the development of reproductive health biomarkers.","83":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) represents the leading endocrine problem affecting women of reproductive age, leading to serious complications related to reproduction, metabolism, and psychosocial aspects. Nonetheless, due to the heterogeneous nature and complex pathophysiology associated with PCOS, this condition remains uncaptured or undertreated as it often gets diagnosed at an advanced age due to its prevalence. The pathophysiology associated with PCOS involves the combination of genetic factors, resistance, neuroendocrine imbalance, as well as environmental factors that contribute towards hyperandrogenism, ovulation defects, and metabolic disorders as well. Hence, a comprehensive literature survey was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, prioritizing international clinical guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and high-quality preclinical studies that covered publications from 2015 to 2025, with the search terms being keywords specific to the disease. At present, the treatments such as lifestyle correction, combined oral pills, and anti-insulin therapies along with anti-androgen drugs only have symptomatic roles with no impact on the underlying mechanism associated with PCOS. However, new therapeutic modalities have been proposed from the past few years that is addressed by this narrative review, including mesenchymal stem cell-based therapies, microbiome therapies, as well as second-generation pharmacotherapies such as GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors. This is being complemented by equal developments in artificial intelligence and the learning process. However, there is work that needs to be done in relation to harmonizing the criteria for diagnosis and the long-term safety and accessibility of effective treatments. Moving forward, the focus should be placed on phenotype-based, precision, and multidisciplinary treatments of PCOS, along with emphasizing the necessity of sturdy clinical validation before worldwide adoption.","84":"Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (BC) remain at risk of distant recurrence for up to 20 years after diagnosis, with an overall recurrence rate of approximately 30%. Although tamoxifen is a cornerstone of endocrine therapy, its long-term effects on metastatic niche formation remain poorly defined. Here, we investigated the impact of long-term tamoxifen treatment on metastatic niche formation. Using PyMT and 4T1 allograft mouse models, we found that tamoxifen increased lung metastasis, despite reduced or unchanged primary tumor size. Lungs from tamoxifen-treated mice exhibited fibrotic features, such as collagen deposition, increased airway wall thickness, and altered expression levels of fibrosis-associated proteins. These changes were accompanied by elevated neutral lipid levels and upregulation of lipid metabolism-related genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed an expansion of a macrophage subpopulation enriched for lipid metabolic gene signatures and exhibiting strong interaction with fibroblasts via TGF\u03b2 signaling. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry further demonstrated an increased number of PRG4+ macrophages in the lungs of tamoxifen-treated mice. Importantly, inhibition of lipid accumulation with the fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75 reduced PRG4+ macrophage numbers, attenuated fibrosis, and suppressed lung metastasis. Together, these findings implicate long-term tamoxifen treatment as a potential risk factor for lung metastasis in ER-positive BC by disrupting the lung microenvironment, and suggest that targeting lipid metabolism may represent a therapeutic strategy to limit metastatic progression, particularly in the lung.","85":"Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the first-line therapy for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), yet a subset of patients responds inadequately, with the underlying mechanisms remaining unclear. In this longitudinal, multi-omics pilot study employing a small-sample human model, we investigated the role of gut microbiota-mitochondrial metabolic dysregulation in influencing the heterogeneity of UDCA treatment response. Our exploratory analysis revealed that UDCA nonresponders exhibit persistent gut dysbiosis, characterized by the depletion of beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria, the expansion of opportunistic fungi such as Candida albicans, and the enrichment of a pro-inflammatory bacterial network centered on Collinsella. Functionally, this dysbiosis in nonresponders is characterized by an enrichment of microbial virulence factors (e.g., flagella) and impaired host energy metabolism, particularly mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle dysfunction, as supported by persistently elevated serum pyruvate levels. Conversely, UDCA responders exhibit remodeling of the gut microbiota and improved mitochondrial function, with significant enrichment of serum itaconate. As a proof-of-concept, an integrated microbiota-metabolite predictive model showed potential in identifying nonresponders within our cohort.However, its performance requires validation in independent cohorts, and its clinical utility remains unknown. Overall, this pilot study proposes that UDCA nonresponse may represent a distinct pathological state centered on persistent mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction, offering preliminary insights for developing personalized therapeutic strategies that target the gut-mitochondrion axis.","86":"Bupleurum chinense (Bc) is a traditional Chinese medicine commonly used to treat metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), demonstrating hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) regulates fatty acid metabolism and oxidative stress, playing a crucial role in MAFLD treatment. To investigate Bc's mechanisms in ameliorating MAFLD and analyze the primary active components contributing to its therapeutic effects. C57BL\/6J mice developed MAFLD through 12-week high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, followed by 4-week interventions with Bc decoction (1.3, 0.65, 0.325 g\/kg\/d) or pioglitazone (0.1 g\/kg\/d). Lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance were measured. RNA-seq identified the key Bc targets, which were validated in liver-specific knockout mice. Bioactive constituents were initially screened using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database, followed by molecular docking, dynamics simulations, and microscale thermophoresis (MST) to validate target affinity and binding stability. An in vitro MAFLD model was established using primary mouse hepatocytes (MPHs) challenged with oleic and palmitic acid (OAPA). Bc significantly ameliorated lipid accumulation and HFD-induced oxidative stress. Pioglitazone and Bc (1.3 g\/kg\/d) administration demonstrated marked reductions in circulating TG, ALT, and AST concentrations in a dose-responsive manner. Furthermore, Bc ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress, as evidenced by elevated GSH and SOD levels alongside reduced H\u2082O\u2082 content. Transcriptomic profiling and mechanistic validation identified SIRT6 as the central mediator. Bc upregulated SIRT6 expression and enhanced its deacetylase activity, resulting in reduced acetylation of histone H3K9 and H3K56 compared to HFD controls. This promoted PPAR\u03b1\/NRF2 nuclear translocation, upregulating fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation genes (such as Cpt1a) and antioxidant genes (such as Ho-1). Crucially, hepatocyte-specific Sirt6 knockout abolished Bc's therapeutic effects. Moreover, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and MST results indicated that Saikosaponin C (SSc), the major component of Bc, has a strong affinity for SIRT6. Cell experiments confirmed that SSc (25 \u03bcM) significantly improved lipid deposition and redox imbalance in MAFLD models, exhibiting SIRT6-dependent efficacy. Bc alleviates MAFLD by activating SIRT6 through its core component SSc. This activation, via SIRT6-mediated histone deacetylation, enhances PPAR\u03b1\/NRF2-driven metabolic-redox homeostasis, establishing the Bc-SSc-SIRT6 axis as a therapeutic target.","87":"Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2<\/sub>S), once regarded merely as a malodorous and toxic gas, has emerged as a vital endogenous signaling molecule with multifaceted physiological roles, encompassing neuromodulation, vasorelaxation, cytoprotection, and the regulation of inflammatory responses. Despite this growing recognition of its biological significance, the therapeutic translation of H<sub>2<\/sub>S remains impeded by its physicochemical limitations as volatility, poor aqueous solubility, and rapid metabolic clearance. Addressing these challenges has stimulated the development of polymeric hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2<\/sub>S) donors engineered macromolecular systems capable of releasing H<sub>2<\/sub>S in a temporally and spatially controlled manner. These structure-responsive materials offer a powerful platform wherein molecular architecture, donor chemistry, and supramolecular organization can be finely tuned to regulate release kinetics and responsiveness to physiological stimuli such as pH variations, redox gradients, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This review consolidates recent advances in the design and application of polymeric and macromolecular H<sub>2<\/sub>S donors, emphasizing the mechanistic relationships between structural parameters polymer topology, donor incorporation strategy, linker chemistry, hydrophilicity, and crosslinking density and their resultant release behaviors. Furthermore, it highlights the expanding biomedical landscape of these materials, discussing their therapeutic potential, translational challenges, and emerging strategies for precision engineering. By bridging molecular-level design with macroscopic functionality, this review aims to inform the rational development of next-generation polymeric H<sub>2<\/sub>S donors that enable finely controlled spatiotemporal delivery and enhanced therapeutic efficacy.","88":"This study investigates how Perilipin 5 (Plin5), a lipid droplet-associated protein crucial for regulating intracellular lipid metabolism, modulates glycolysis, apoptosis, and mitochondrial function under high glucose conditions, with a focus on its therapeutic potential in Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). AC16 human cardiomyocyte cells and human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) were transfected with Plin5-overexpressing lentivirus. An in vivo DCM model was established in wild-type and Plin5-knockout mice using a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Cardiac function was evaluated, and cellular mechanisms were assessed using molecular biology techniques and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Plin5 overexpression significantly enhanced glycolysis (e.g., a 2.5-fold increase in extracellular acidification rate, p<0.001) in both AC16 and HCFs. In AC16 cells, high glucose treatment upregulated Plin5 expression, whereas in HCFs, it led to downregulation. Apoptosis-related protein levels, including BCL-2 and cleaved Caspase-3, were modulated by Plin5 overexpression, with a notable impact under high glucose conditions. Cardiac ultrasound revealed significant differences in systolic function (EF values) across experimental groups. Ki67 staining showed enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation in Plin5-overexpressing groups under normal glucose conditions, while TUNEL assays indicated reduced apoptosis, though this effect was attenuated under high glucose conditions. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a significant upregulation of fatty acid metabolism pathways in the diabetic heart, with Plin5 expression specifically increased in cardiomyocytes. In summary, this study demonstrates that Plin5 plays a critical role in regulating glycolysis, apoptosis, and cardiomyocyte proliferation, particularly under varying glucose conditions, identifying it as a potential therapeutic target for DCM.","89":"Implant-associated infections have become a persistent threat affecting the success rate of clinical implant surgeries. Existing multitype antimicrobial films for implant surfaces still suffer from such problems as film detachment and erroneous killing of normal cells. Targeting the dual-core processes of the electron transport chain (ETC) and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) within bacterial energy metabolism networks, this work employs an engineered ion implantation method to sequentially inject copper ions and hydrogen ion onto the surface of the nickel-titanium alloy, developing a nondetachable, interface-free modified layer. Hydrogen ion implantation reduces exposed nickel oxide on the substrate to metallic nickel, forming a Cu-Ni microgalvanic system, which can continuously capture electrons from the bacterial membrane ETC, thereby inhibiting bacterial adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Furthermore, copper ions are intracellularly released via bacterial membrane ion channels, triggering a cuprotosis-like process. This process impairs bacterial metabolism, manifested as reduced iron uptake, diminished heme utilization capability, and inhibition of the TCA cycle. <i>In vivo<\/i> experiments validate its potent antibacterial effect in the infected subcutaneous tissue of a rat model. Moreover, the film can facilitate rapid surface endothelialization. This engineered dual-pathway interference strategy targeting bacterial energy metabolism provides the theoretical guidance for safely reducing the risk of implant infections.","90":"Carbapenem-resistant (CR) organisms (CRO) have been identified as critical priority pathogens, emphasizing the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Combination therapy emerges as a promising approach to address multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Here we demonstrate that eravacycline (ERV), in combination with amikacin (AMK), effectively eliminates a panel of clinically isolated CR Escherichia coli, CR Klebsiella pneumoniae, and CR Acinetobacter baumannii. Mechanistically, the AMK-ERV combination enhances bacterial oxidative phosphorylation, leading to an accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which induce oxidative stress and accelerate bacterial cell death. Notably, this combination significantly improves survival rates in mouse models of intra-abdominal infection, demonstrating efficacy against infections induced by CR pathogens. Furthermore, serum metabolomics reveals that the AMK-ERV combination upregulates metabolic pathways of lipids and amino acids. Interestingly, the amino acid methionine significantly enhances the antibacterial activity of ERV against CR pathogens both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings underscore the potential of repurposing AMK in combination with ERV to combat CR pathogens and propose a novel strategy for controlling these infections through the combination of antibiotics with specific metabolites such as methionine.","91":"Efficient derivation of neural stem cells (NSCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is crucial in regenerative medicine. Here, we report that the combined application of the retinoic acid receptor agonist TTNPB and the GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor CHIR99021 in a chemically defined medium enabled the induction of a highly advanced NSCs (ANSCs) population from PSCs. ANSCs display robust neuroectodermal gene expression and a heightened capacity for neural lineage commitment. The combination of TTNPB and CHIR99021 markedly enhanced global chromatin accessibility, particularly at neuroectoderm-specific regulatory elements such as PAX6 and SOX1, in parallel with reduced accessibility at the loci of pluripotency factors. Notably, TTNPB alone also exerts a marked effect in enhancing chromatin accessibility. Untargeted metabolomic analysis identified a distinct neural-ectoderm associated metabolic state in ANSCs, prominently characterized by elevated choline, alongside S-(5'-adenosyl)-L-homocysteine, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, and glutathione. Exogenous addition of these metabolites was sufficient to induce neuroectodermal marker expression, highlighting the instructive role of the metabolic network in neural fate induction. Moreover, functional studies showed that ANSCs enabled engraftment into depressed rat hippocampi and restored depression-like behavioral deficits. Our study presents a novel small-molecule strategy that leverages TTNPB-centered epigenetic remodeling and metabolic reprogramming as dual mechanisms driving neural differentiation.","92":"BackgroundParkinson's disease is (PD) a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. This study investigated the effects of an individualized nutritional intervention based on the Ketoflex 12\/3 protocol, in addition to standard medical treatment, on motor and non-motor symptoms in PD.Methods40 individuals with PD were included in the study, and participants were randomly assigned to intervention and control. All individuals were classified according to inflammatory, glycotoxic, toxic, and vascular biotypes. The intervention group was assigned a plant-rich diet with a low glycemic index, consistent with ketogenic principles, free of inflammatory effects, and including intermittent fasting. The primary endpoint was the change in motor symptoms measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) from baseline to six months. Secondary endpoints included apathy (Starkstein Apathy Scale), activities of daily living (ADL\/IADL), and gastrointestinal function (Bristol stool scale).ResultsCompared with the control group, the intervention group showed a significantly greater improvement in motor symptoms as measured by UPDRS-III (-11.0 vs +2.1 points from baseline to six months; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Significant between-group differences were also observed for secondary endpoints, including apathy (Starkstein Apathy Scale), activities of daily living (ADL\/IADL), and gastrointestinal function (Bristol stool scale), all favoring the intervention group. Spearman correlation analyses revealed significant negative correlations with ADL and UPDRS-III scores, particularly in individuals with an inflammatory phenotype.ConclusionsThe findings suggest an individualized nutritional approach may contribute to improvement in both motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. Larger, multi-center trials with extended follow-up are needed.","93":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to standard-of-care agents is increasing. It is imperative to identify new combinations that increase the rate and depth of bacterial kill, shorten therapy and also suppress resistance. There has been little prior effort to identify combination regimens that employ new or repurposed drugs in a rational way. Our group developed a pathway to combine agents to achieve this end. This pathway starts with standard baseline evaluations (e.g., MIC), leverages information from in vitro assessments (hollow fiber infection model), then analyzes 2-agent combinations in a 96 well quantitative culture checkerboard format (Greco URSA model with simulation). Finally, development of a high dimensional mathematical model allowed evaluation of 2- and 3-drug regimens in multiple metabolic states to draw inferences regarding combination therapies. We prospectively evaluated these regimens in animal models. We showed that a prospectively chosen regimen of pretomanid, moxifloxacin plus bedaquiline performed as predicted. In the BALB\/c murine model, this regimen produced sterilization in a cohort that was held for 12 weeks after therapy cessation, as it did in the C3HeB\/FeJ (\"Kramnik\") murine model. Finally, this and other regimens were evaluated in a cynomolgus macaque model. The decrement of the 18F-deoxyglucose signal in Positron emission tomography (PET)- computed tomography (CT) evaluations was best with this regimen. Other endpoints such as necropsy score and colony counts in lung and lymph nodes also demonstrated that this regimen behaved as predicted from our pathway\/algorithm. We conclude that this provides a way forward for the future to identify the most promising regimens to shorten therapy for tuberculosis and suppress emergence of resistance.","94":"Pancreatitis-associated sepsis (PAS) caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria poses significant clinical challenges. The objective of this research was to examine the microbial and metabolic profiles of individuals with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and Escherichia coli (CREC) infections using integrated microbiomics and metabolomics approaches. Peripheral blood samples from 11 PAS patients (8 CRAB, 3 CREC) were analyzed using 16S rDNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics via LC-MS. Microbial diversity, community structure, and differential metabolites were examined between CRAB and CREC groups. CRAB patients exhibited higher microbial diversity compared to CREC patients. p-Proteobacteria, p-Firmicutes, and p-Cyanobacteria predominated in both patient groups. Significant differences in microbial composition were observed, with p-Proteobacteria more abundant in CRAB and p-Cyanobacteria in CREC samples. g-Enhydrobacter and s-Moraxella osloensis were the biomarkers, significantly higher in CREC patients. Metabolomic analysis revealed 328 differential metabolites between groups, with the majority being downregulated in CRAB. The main categories of identified differential metabolites were amino acids and their derivatives. These differential metabolites were closely related to various metabolic pathways. The most significant metabolic difference between the two patient groups was the level of triglycerides. R-2 Methanandamide and 13-(\u03b2-D-glucosyloxy) docosanoic acid showed the highest correlation with g-Enhydrobacter and s-Moraxella osloensis. In PAS patients, s-Moraxella osloensis is a biomarker distinguishing CRAB and CREC infections, correlating with R-2 Methanandamide and 13-(\u03b2-D-glucosyloxy) docosanoic acid.","95":"Sphingolipid metabolism is an important component of various biological processes, particularly in cancer pathology. This metabolic pathway significantly influences the behavior of cancer cells by regulating growth, apoptosis, and survival. Although modulating sphingolipid metabolism has attracted attention as a novel therapeutic strategy, its complexity and specific mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In the current study, transcriptomic profiling was employed to compare the expression of sphingolipid metabolism-related genes between normal solid tissues and lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Additionally, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were performed to investigate the functional relevance of these genes. Twelve sphingolipid metabolism-related genes formed a highly interconnected core, suggesting their potential central role within the regulatory network. Four genes were found to be significantly correlated with overall survival. Notably, B4GALNT1 upregulation and CERS4 downregulation correlated with advanced tumor stage and metastasis. They also showed prognostic significance in Cox regression analyses, and these findings were consistently validated in an independent cohort. In vitro, within lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, B4GALNT1 knockdown and CERS4 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, supporting their roles in lung adenocarcinoma progression. These findings highlight B4GALNT1 and CERS4 as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in lung adenocarcinoma, warranting further clinical investigation.","96":"Obesity adversely affects atrial fibrillation (AF) outcomes and is associated with higher recurrence after catheter ablation. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) promote weight loss and improve metabolic inflammation, but their role as adjuncts to ablation has not been completely defined. This study investigated the impact of semaglutide on post-ablation rhythm outcomes in obese patients with AF. This single-centre, propensity-matched study included obese patients (BMI \u226530 kg\/m\u00b2) undergoing first-time catheter ablation for paroxysmal AF (2019-2024). Patients who initiated semaglutide within 3 months before or 1 month after ablation were compared with matched controls who did not receive GLP-1RA therapy. All patients underwent continuous rhythm monitoring using implantable cardiac monitors. The primary endpoint was any atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence beyond a two-month blanking period. The final cohort included 181 semaglutide-treated patients and 181 controls with matched clinical and procedural characteristics. At 18-month follow-up, freedom from recurrence was 80.2% vs 65.2%, respectively; semaglutide was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrence (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.78; p=0.002). Weight and BMI decreased significantly in the semaglutide group (-11.8\u00b13.8 kg; -4.0\u00b11.4 kg\/m\u00b2) compared with controls (-1.9\u00b11.2 kg; -0.3\u00b10.8 kg\/m\u00b2; both p<0.001). A substantial proportion of treated patients achieved \u226510% weight reduction. GLP-1RA therapy using semaglutide is associated with a reduced risk of AF recurrence in obese patients undergoing AF catheter ablation, indicating its potential as an adjunctive treatment. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the effects of GLP-1RA on AF recurrence.","97":"The ketogenic diet (KD) is an established nonpharmacological therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Emerging evidence suggests the KD can modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) and that this interaction may influence clinical response to the intervention. To synthesize current evidence on MGBA alterations following a KD in the setting of DRE (DRE+KD) and on the associations between MGBA parameters and clinical outcomes after the diet. A systematic search was conducted of the PubMed\/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases in July 2025. Two reviewers independently screened 799 records and extracted data from the eligible studies. We included original, peer-reviewed, longitudinal research. Findings were synthesized narratively, and the risk of bias (RoB) was appraised using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies. Seven articles (n\u2009=\u200993 patients with DRE+KD) met the predefined eligibility criteria. We found a decreased abundance of the phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and increased abundance of Bacteroidetes after KD. Functional routes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were diminished, and fatty acid-related pathways were increased. Levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and circulating inflammatory proteins also decreased, whereas those of ketone-related metabolites increased. While health-promoting MGBA features (eg, Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, SCFAs, plasmalogens) were associated with better seizure control, other taxa (eg, Ruminococcaceae, Escherichia coli, infant-type Bifidobacterium) were linked to poorer outcomes. Overall RoB was moderate to high. Our findings suggest the KD induces recurrent MGBA-related changes in patients with DRE. Additionally, some taxonomic and metabolic profiles are associated with better seizure control. However, a moderate to high RoB, small samples, high heterogeneity, and predominantly hospital and pediatric cohorts limit the certainty and generalizability of the evidence. Nonetheless, the findings provide a rationale for further studying the interplay among KD, the MGBA, and DRE. Future research should prioritize including adults, larger samples, deep sequencing platforms, and explore potential microbiota-informed adjunctive therapies for DRE. PROSPERO registration no.

This study explores structural and molecular changes in kidneys after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), a form of MBS. Methods Paired analyses, including metabolic profiling, kidney volume assessment, histological evaluation, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on kidney biopsies from five youth with T2D and obesity pre- and 12 months post-VSG in the IMPROVE-T2D (Impact of Metabolic surgery on Pancreatic, Renal and cardiOVascular hEalth in youth with T2D) cohort. Circulating proteomics with kidney transcriptomics, were linked using data from an independent cohort of youth with obesity, with or without T2D, undergoing MBS in Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS, n=64). Results Post-VSG, participants lost weight and had improvements in insulin sensitivity and metabolic parameters. Kidney changes included reduced renal hyperfiltration, total kidney volume, mesangial matrix area, and microalbuminuria. scRNAseq in proximal tubule (PT) and thick ascending limb cells indicated repression of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and tricarboxylic acid cycle genes, with upregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3). Decreased metabolic signaling aligned with reduced ribosomal phosphorylated S6K (pS6K), suggesting attenuated mTORC1 activity.
