COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the critical need for novel therapeutic approaches. Favipiravir (FAV), an antiviral drug primarily used for influenza, has shown promising potential in treating COVID-19 and other RNA viral infections. A precise, reliable, and rapid fluorimetric method was established for the quantification of FAV in pharmaceutical formulations, even in the presence of its acid-induced degradation product. The acid-induced degradation product (ADP) of FAV was prepared through forced degradation, followed by characterization using IR and MS. The method leveraged the intrinsic fluorescence characteristics of FAV, exhibiting a linear response within the concentration range of 5-80 ng\/mL at 416.5\u00a0nm using the first-order derivative processing. Key methodological parameters were optimized to enhance sensitivity, achieving detection and quantification limits of 1.6 ng\/mL and 4.8 ng\/mL, respectively. All calibration and fluorimetric measurement steps were performed in distilled water without the use of organic solvents or buffers, making the analytical determination phase entirely aqueous and environmentally benign. This method was effectively applied to FAV in both pure drug and pharmaceutical dosage forms. Compared with previously reported fluorimetric methods, it offers the unique combination of aqueous-based operation, stability-indicating capability, and superior analytical performance. Additionally, its environmental sustainability was evaluated using GAPI, AGREE, and RGB12 metrics, which confirmed its green and eco-friendly attributes.","1":"No abstract available","2":"Children and adolescents living with HIV face unique physical, psychological, and social challenges that can significantly affect their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Understanding the dimensions and determinants of HRQoL among them is crucial to developing solutions to improve their overall well-being. This research aimed to assess the HRQoL and its determinants among children and adolescents living with HIV in Eastern Uganda. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 228 respondents. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were assessed using an investigator-designed questionnaire, and HRQoL was assessed using the World Health Organization HIV Quality of Life - BREF tool. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify independent factors associated with HRQoL. The mean age of the respondents was 13.68\u2009\u00b1\u20091.95 years, 129 (56.58%) were female, and 182 (79.82%) perceived high support from friends. The mean QoL was highest within the spiritual domain (17.07\u2009\u00b1\u20093.11), while the independence domain indicated the lowest quality of life (14.57\u2009\u00b1\u20092.26). Approximately 48.5% attained the mean overall QoL score (96.22). Better financial status (being not well off or quite well off) was significantly associated with higher scores across physical, psychological, independence, environmental, spiritual, and overall QoL (p\u2009<\u20090.05). High perceived family support was also positively associated with higher psychological, environmental, spiritual, and overall QoL scores. In contrast, family history of mental illness and the presence of other chronic illnesses were significantly associated with lower psychological and environmental scores. Being Muslim\/other religion was associated with lower physical domain scores, while being in high school or above was linked to better environmental scores. Spirituality was a key source of emotional support, reflected in the highest QoL scores, while low independence scores suggest that stigma and overprotection may hinder autonomy and social development. Although overall QoL was generally good, disparities across domains underscore the need for targeted interventions. Improved financial status and strong family support were consistently associated with better QoL outcomes, while comorbid conditions and a family history of mental illness negatively impacted well-being among children and adolescents living with HIV in Eastern Uganda.","3":"No abstract available","4":"No abstract available","5":"Inflammatory dermatoses like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are prevalent autoimmune disorders whose management is challenged not only by inflammatory lesions but, more significantly, by persistent pruritus and frequent relapse following treatment discontinuation. The pathogenic progression of these dermatoses is critically influenced by an imbalance between pro-inflammatory adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and anti-inflammatory cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), alongside reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. To address this imbalance and effectively scavenge ROS, we have developed AC@Mg\/Ce-UiO, integrating adenylate cyclase (AC) with a defect-engineered Mg\/Ce-UiO nanozyme, for inflammatory dermatosis treatment and recurrence prevention. Mg\/Ce-UiO nanozyme, synthesized through a metal-substitution strategy, demonstrates enhanced superoxide dismutase-like and catalase-like activities, facilitating efficient ROS scavenging. Concurrently, the encapsulated AC enzyme catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cAMP. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that AC@Mg\/Ce-UiO markedly downregulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines and pruritogens, inhibits keratinocyte hyperproliferation, and diminishes the infiltration of immune memory T cells. Consequently, this nanozyme not only alleviates psoriatic symptoms (e.g., lesions and pruritus), but also decreases the likelihood of recurrence. This study introduces a safe and potent dual-catalytic therapy that targets the fundamental pathogenesis of inflammatory dermatoses, providing a promising strategy for achieving long-term remission and preventing recurrence.","6":"No abstract available","7":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and potentially fatal complication in orthopedic trauma patients, particularly following lower limb and hip-related fractures. While pharmacological prophylaxis is the cornerstone of prevention for patients at moderate to high risk, its use is a balance between efficacy and bleeding risk. Clinical pharmacists play an increasingly important role in optimizing pharmacotherapy, but evidence for the effectiveness of a comprehensive, pharmacist-led management model spanning both inpatient and outpatient care for VTE prophylaxis in this population is scarce. This is a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial. One hundred seventy eligible orthopedic trauma patients at risk for VTE will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group will receive a pharmacist-led, full-course management model, which includes personalized VTE risk (Caprini score) and bleeding risk assessment, medication reconciliation, patient education, dosing optimization, adverse event monitoring, and structured follow-up via telephone at 21, 35, and 90\u00a0days post-discharge. The control group will receive standard medical care without this structured pharmacist intervention. The primary outcome is the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic VTE within 90\u00a0days post-surgery. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events, medication adherence (measured by Medication Possession Ratio). Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. This randomized controlled trial aims to generate high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of a clinical pharmacist-led management model for improving outcomes in orthopedic trauma patients requiring VTE prophylaxis. The study has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (retrospectively registered no. ChiCTR2500107932) on 21 August 2025, at https:\/\/www.chictr.org.cn\/showproj?proj=279391.","8":"Streptococcus anginosus is a Gram-positive coccus that can increase gastric cancer risk through interaction with the TMPC-ANXA2-MAPK axis in gastric epithelial cells. There is currently no commercially available vaccine, and prolonged antibiotic treatment may increase drug resistance. We developed a Treponema pallidum membrane protein C (TMPC)-based multi-epitope vaccine targeting nine TMPC-positive streptococcal species dominated by S. anginosus. B-cell and T-cell epitopes were chosen based on their binding affinity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and safety, with adjuvants and linker sequences improving construct stability and immune response. Immune simulations predicted robust humoral and cellular responses, such as cytokine production and memory cell activation. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics analysis further confirmed stable interactions between the vaccine construct and key immune receptors (HLA-A*02:01, HLA-DRB1*01:01, TLR2, and TLR4). The antigen was further modified as a messenger RNA vaccine to enhance cytotoxic T-cell induction; however, animal research is needed to confirm its immunogenicity and protective effectiveness.","9":"Rift valley fever virus (RVFV) is among the WHO list of priority diseases, yet no effective vaccine or treatment is currently available. Microbial pigments (MPs) represent a promising small-molecules library which can be exploited for the drug discovery of anti-RVFV compound. In this study, thirteen MPs were in silico screened to identify candidates with acceptable drug-likeness and possible ability to cross the blood brain barrier. Next, the binding interaction of the filtered molecules were compared against key RVFV proteins for the selection of the optimum inhibitor. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed (200 ns) to further evaluate the interactions. The selected candidate (pyocyanin; PCN) was produced, purified and analytically characterized in-house. Finally, the antiviral potential of PCN was tested in vitro against RVFV using the tissue culture infection dose 50% (TCID<sub>50<\/sub>) method. In silico screening studies revealed that prodigiosin and PCN exhibit ideal drug-likeness properties. PCN exerted a promising in silico interaction with the key RVFV proteins as revealed by the molecular docking and dynamic studies. Results showed that PCN may be effectively produced and purified from bacterial cultures. Its cell-safe concentration (0.49 \u03bcg\/mL) demonstrated a promising 2.89 log<sub>10<\/sub> reduction in TCID<sub>50<\/sub> when incubated with RVFV infected cells. A lower effect was observed (2.00 log<sub>10<\/sub> reduction) in cells treated with PCN prior to RVFV infection. These results suggest that PCN may represent a potential effective low-cost molecule to combat RVFV.","10":"Williams syndrome is a rare genetic condition frequently associated with cardiovascular anomalies, particularly supravalvular aortic stenosis. The coexistence of supravalvular aortic stenosis, aneurysmal dilation, and infective endocarditis with vegetations in the aortic arch is exceedingly rare. We describe an 8-year-old Arab boy from Syria with Williams syndrome who presented with fatigue, tachycardia, dyspnea, fever, chills, and night sweats. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated aortic arch with large vegetation at the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk and supravalvular aortic stenosis. Despite 10 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy, vegetations persisted, necessitating urgent surgery. The ascending aorta was replaced using the McGoon technique with complete excision of infected tissue. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and follow-up imaging showed good left ventricular function without aortic gradient. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and timely surgical intervention in preventing catastrophic outcomes in patients with Williams syndrome and complex cardiovascular involvement.","11":"No abstract available","12":"Low Back Pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide, 90% of which is nonspecific. Manual therapy is one of the recommended treatment modalities. However, reported outcomes may be variable. This review aims to identify their scope in the context of the development of a Core Outcome Set (COS), which is defined as \u00ab an agreed standardised set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials in specific areas of health or health care \u00bb. A scoping review with risk of bias assessment of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of manual therapy for nonspecific LBP was conducted using MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PEDro, WebOfScience and ClinicalTrials.gov, from 2010 up to August 2024. Manual therapy was considered the use, alone or in combination, of manipulations (high velocity, low amplitude), mobilisations (low-grade velocity, small-to-large amplitude) or soft tissue relaxation (especially massage, trigger points, muscle contractions). Out of 3929 articles, 147 RCTs and 74 protocols were included. Two main outcomes emerged: pain intensity (assessed by numerical rating scale or visual analogue scale) and disability (mostly assessed by Rolland-Morris Disability Questionnaire or Oswestry Disability Index). Range of motion is the most frequent clinical outcome assessed. Psychological factors such as fear-avoidance beliefs, kinesiophobia and catastrophising, and healthcare consumption, particularly medication, are also frequent. Most of the outcomes were patient-reported outcomes. Consistent with a previous COS on nonspecific low back pain, manual therapy appears to address the same outcomes. Clinical trials in manual therapy should focus on using the existing COS by measuring pain intensity using a numerical rating scale, disability using the ODI 2.1a or the 24-item RMDQ, health-related quality of life using the SF-12 or the 10-item PROMIS. Additionally, due to the gap between clinical research and pain experience, trials should consider conducting subgroup analyses to identify effects on outcomes related to gender or age, paying particular attention to health inequalities by carrying out analyses based on socioeconomic status, as these factors are well known to significantly impact pain experience and access to care.

Accumulated evidence has demonstrated lactylation plays a vital role in the metabolic reprogramming. However the mechanisms underlying the role of lactylation in the regulation of HCC progression remain largely unknown. This study aims to construct a prognostic model based on lactylation-related metabolism genes, and further explore its prognostic significance and biological function in HCC. In this study, a robust prognostic prediction model has been constructed employing a complex machine learning framework using public bulk RNA-seq and proteomic HCC dataset. Moreover, the clinical application of this model was explored, and its biological functions were validated using several in vitro experiments. Subsequently, we performed functional analysis, survival analysis, tumor immune microenvironment analysis and drug sensitivity to demonstrate our model's potential in translational cancer medicine. We developed an integrative machine learning-based computational framework to generate a predictive Metabolism-related Lactylation Index (MRLI) within four independent HCC cohorts and validated its prognostic accuracy through various algorithms. Notably, compared to published gene signatures, MRLI demonstrated robust predictive capability. In addition, single-cell analysis demonstrated that the MRLI is predominantly localized within HCC cells and correlates with tumor malignancy. Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested that the MRLI may be associated with cellular proliferation and metabolic reprogramming, which was further confirmed by experimental evidence. Subsequently, public spatial transcriptomics and bulk RNA-seq analysis revealing that the highly MRLI predicts a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, which was further verification in a cohort of 40 HCC samples by multiple immunofluorescence. Additionally, groups with highly MRLI showed decreased sensitivity to sorafenib, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and TACE, highlighting the potential of MRLI in facilitating personalized treatment strategies. Our study has developed a novel MRLI as a predictive marker for prognosis and therapeutic outcomes in patients with HCC. These findings indicate that lactylation promotes malignant cell phenotypes and immune microenvironment remodeling partially through metabolic regulation, suggesting it as a potential clinical therapeutic target.","18":"Synthetic lethality (SL) is a therapeutic approach that selectively target cancer cells via the disruption of two interdependent molecular targets, which together become essential in the cancer context to ensure cancer cell survival. Among anticancer SL strategies, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of homologous recombination repair deficient breast and ovarian cancers by targeting the remaining DNA repair mechanisms. However, resistance emergence is nearly universal providing the rationale to expand beyond classical DNA repair targets. Severe DNA lesions like double-strand breaks or extended single-strand stretches trigger the complex DNA damage response signaling cascade (DDR), which provides many SL targets in addition to direct DNA repair mechanisms. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy, in part because of late detection and treatment resistance, which provides a rich environment to explore the concept of combining multiple targets to produce SL synergies that kill cancer cells. In this context we discuss the interplay among varied components of the DDR including DNA damage signalers, cell cycle regulation, metabolism, epigenetics, and subsequent cell fate decisions like apoptosis or senescence. Based on this knowledge we further explore innovative SL approaches that may elicit or restore drug sensitivity in resistant tumors. Overall, we provide the rationale for multidimensional strategies linking classic DNA repair mechanisms to various molecular vulnerabilities sometimes apparently unrelated or downstream from DNA damage to improve cancer treatment outcomes via more effective and durable therapeutic responses, offering additional options for the personalized treatment of this highly heterogeneous disease.","19":"Ethnically diverse populations can present variations in cardiovascular risk, which can be influenced by differences in lipid profiles and other cardiovascular risk factors. This study aimed to evaluate lipid profiles and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in a Mediterranean population, with a focus on variations by ethnicity and sex. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study using the \"Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care\" (SIDIAP) database, which includes primary care data from Catalonia, Spain, collected between 2015 and 2019. The study included subjects aged 40 to 89 years with no prior history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or lipid-lowering therapy. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare lipid profiles and traditional risk factors across ethnic groups and sex. We included 806,458 participants, 56.8% women, 89.9% from Southern Europe, 5.3% from Latin America and Caribbean origin, 3% from North Africa, 0.8% from Central\/South Africa and 1% from Asia. Asian individuals presented the most atherogenic lipid profile, with the lower HDL-C, higher triglyceride levels, and elevated atherogenic indices. Higher LDL-C values were observed in Latin American men and Southern European women. Among the groups studied, Central and South Africans presented the most favorable lipid profiles, with low triglyceride and atherogenic indices, regardless of sex. North Africans and Latin Americans presented higher obesity rates, whilst southern Europeans presented the highest prevalence rates of hypertension and smoking. Individuals from Asia have worse lipid and metabolic profile compared with Central and South African individuals, regardless of sex. Current risk assessment tools may underestimate the cardiovascular risk in these specific populations.","20":"No abstract available","21":"Although androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies have shown notable clinical efficacy in prostate cancer (PCa), the emergence of drug resistance remains a critical factor driving the clinical prognosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Aberrant tumor lipid metabolism not only fulfills the energetic and biosynthetic requirements of rapidly proliferating cancer cells but also contributes to the development of therapeutic resistance. We examined SOX8 expression in enzalutamide resistance (EnzR) cell lines and validated its association with tumor progression and clinical outcome. The malignant phenotypes related to EnzR were assessed in vitro using PCa cell lines with stable SOX8 overexpression or knockdown. Tumor xenografts were subsequently generated by inoculating the corresponding cell lines into nude mice. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we conducted RNA-seq, CUT&Tag, non-targeted metabolomics, and a series of molecular and biochemical assays. SOX8 expression was elevated in EnzR prostate cancer cell lines and positively correlated with poor patient prognosis. Reduced SOX8 expression enhanced cellular sensitivity to enzalutamide, whereas elevated SOX8 expression decreased drug responsiveness. Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) assays revealed that AR was enriched at the SOX8 promoter region and transcriptionally repressed SOX8. In vivo, stable SOX8 knockdown markedly suppressed tumor growth in nude mouse xenografts. Mechanistically, SOX8 promotes the EnzR by reprograming lipid metabolism and we identified carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), a key enzyme in lipid metabolism, as a novel downstream target of SOX8. SOX8-driven lipid metabolic reprogramming promoted enzalutamide resistance through the SOX8\/CPT2 axis. High SOX8 expression promotes EnzR in PCa, suggesting SOX8 as a potential therapeutic target. Our findings demonstrate that SOX8 drives EnzR by activating the SOX8\/CPT2 axis, thereby inducing lipid metabolic reprogramming in PCa cells.","22":"Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) offer a powerful therapeutic modality by integrating the targeting specificity of peptides with the cytotoxic efficacy of chemotherapeutics, thereby improving antitumor performance while reducing off-target toxicity. In this study, we engineered biometallic PDCs composed of peptide nanofibers (PNFs), gold nanoparticles (GNPs), and doxorubicin (DOX), termed PGDCs, and incorporated them into photo-responsive dual-network hyaluronic acid hydrogels for combined photothermal and chemotherapeutic (PTT\/CT) treatment of breast cancer. The hydrogel was formed by mixing oxidized methacrylated hyaluronic acid (O-HAMA) with PGDCs, followed by rapid photo-crosslinking under 365\u00a0nm UV light, achieving gelation within 90\u00a0s for localized, on-demand drug deployment. The resulting O-HAMA\/PGDC hydrogels exhibited pH-responsive drug release under tumor microenvironments and robust photothermal performance under NIR irradiation. In vitro and in vivo evaluations revealed strong tumor suppression, with 98% inhibition efficiency, effective tumor ablation, and minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissues. The structural modularity of PGDCs-allowing simultaneous integration of metals, peptides, and drugs-opens pathways for designing highly effective, tumor-selective nanotherapeutics with controlled activation, efficient internalization, and combined therapeutic outcomes.","23":"Luspatercept is a recombinant fusion protein that enhances late-stage erythropoiesis by inhibiting select transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) superfamily ligands. It is approved for transfusion-dependent \u03b2-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts. Kidney toxicity has been rarely reported in humans, although glomerular lesions have been described in preclinical studies. We report the case of a 74-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome with ring sideroblasts treated with luspatercept for persistent anemia. She developed acute kidney injury, glomerular-range proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and leukocyturia. Renal biopsy revealed a diffuse mesangial sclerosing glomerulopathy characterized by prominent mesangial matrix expansion with minimal proliferative changes, no immune complex deposits on immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. Luspatercept was discontinued, leading to a partial improvement in renal function but persistent proteinuria. This case documents a non-immune mesangial sclerosing glomerulopathy temporally associated with luspatercept therapy. Only one other case of biopsy-proven renal injury linked to luspatercept has previously been published, with an immune complex-mediated MPGN. Clinicians should be aware of possible renal involvement during luspatercept treatment and consider systematic monitoring of kidney function and urinalysis in treated patients. Further data are needed to clarify the spectrum and mechanisms of renal adverse events associated with this drug.","24":"Phenobarbital (PB) has long been considered the standard first-line therapy for neonatal seizures, despite suboptimal efficacy and concerns about neurotoxicity and adverse cardiopulmonary effects. Levetiracetam (LEV), a newer antiseizure medication with a more favorable safety profile, has emerged as a potential alternative. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of LEV versus PB when used as first-line treatment for neonatal seizures. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to September 2025 identified eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing first-line LEV with PB in neonates. Data were pooled using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity, publication bias, and potential effect modifiers were explored through subgroup, and meta-regression analyses. Twenty-six studies (13 RCTs and 13 observational cohorts) including 9,854 neonates (LEV\u2009=\u20091,601; PB\u2009=\u20098,253) were analyzed. The overall rate of seizure control did not differ significantly between LEV and PB (RR\u2009=\u20090.92, 95% CI 0.82-1.03; p\u2009=\u20090.16). Subgroup analyses by study design yielded consistent findings. LEV was associated with significantly fewer adverse events (RR\u2009=\u20093.59, 95% CI 1.85-6.95; I\u00b2 = 86%), particularly lower risks of hypotension (RR\u2009=\u20093.90, 95% CI 1.94-7.87) and respiratory depression (RR\u2009=\u20092.06, 95% CI 1.23-3.47) compared with PB. Mortality rates were similar between groups (RR\u2009=\u20091.27, 95% CI 0.84-1.91). Meta-regression revealed that higher gestational age and birth weight were associated with better seizure control, whereas older age at seizure onset predicted poorer response. LEV and PB demonstrate comparable efficacy for first-line treatment of neonatal seizures; however, LEV provides a more favorable safety and tolerability profile, particularly with respect to cardiopulmonary stability. These findings support the consideration of LEV as an alternative first-line agent, especially in neonates at risk for hemodynamic or respiratory compromise. Further large, high-quality RCTs with standardized EEG confirmation and long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up are warranted.","25":"For people with HIV (PWH), long-acting antiretroviral therapies (LA-ART) are promising treatment alternatives to daily oral regimens, with potential to improve adherence and achieve viral suppression. Understanding patient preferences is crucial for successful and efficient implementation and scaling of LA-ART in resource-limited settings such as Kenya. We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit preferences for LA-ART attributes among PWH in Kenya. We recruited 700 PWH taking daily oral ART from Kenyatta National Hospital and two Sex Workers Outreach Program clinics in Nairobi. In 17 choice scenarios, participants chose between their current daily oral regimen and two hypothetical LA-ART alternatives defined by seven attributes: delivery mode (long-acting oral, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, implant), administration location (clinic, chemist, home), frequency (weekly, every 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12 months), delivery-site pain (none, mild, moderate), pre-treatment viral suppression (required, not required), pre-treatment negative reaction testing (required, not required), and late-dose leeway (short, long). We used conditional logistic regressions with interactions between mode and pain to determine the relative importance in participants' choices across attributes. Participants had a median age of 36 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 28-46); 64% were female, 83% were virally suppressed, 51% were from key populations (e.g., sex workers or men who have sex with men), and median time on ART was 9 years (IQR: 5-15). Participants generally preferred the hypothetical LA-ART options over their current daily oral ART, and the interaction of delivery mode and pain was the most important attribute combination. Oral LA-ART was the most preferred mode; 1-year implants with mild pain was the next preferred option. Participants favored administration at clinics to chemists or home and preferred less frequent dosing. LA-ART would be highly acceptable in Kenya, with oral LA-ART and administration at clinics as the preferred formulation and location. Our findings provide valuable evidence to guide the development of novel LA-ART products. Future research should evaluate preference heterogeneity and investigate ways to effectively scale LA-ART in Kenya and similar settings, while taking into account patient preferences.

This study aimed to present Chinese data on CTIT and organ bleeding in patients undergoing emergency oncology. This retrospective study was conducted in the Oncology Emergency Department. We evaluated the clinical features and outcomes of CTIT and associated organ hemorrhage. A retrospective analysis collected data from 8590 cases of malignant tumor emergency visits. Among these, 1164 cases (13.5%) of CTIT met the inclusion criteria, with a median patient age of 61\u2009years. 61 (5.24%) of the 1164 CTIT cases were associated with overt organ hemorrhage. Independent risk factors predicting CTIT deterioration included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 2-4 (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20094.883), stage IV (OR\u2009=\u20092.275), organ bleeding (OR\u2009=\u20093.029), anemia (OR\u2009=\u20093.243), and fever (OR\u2009=\u20095.360), all with p\u2009<\u20090.05. Among the 61 cases with bleeding, 41% (25\/61) involved lung cancer. The bleeding group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with fever (11.5% vs. 2.9%), pleural effusion (25.0% vs. 9.8%), and malnutrition requiring parenteral nutritional support (9.8% vs. 2.8%) compared to the non-bleeding group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Fever (OR\u2009=\u20094.886, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and pleural effusion (OR\u2009=\u20094.812, p\u2009=\u20090.007) were identified as independent risk factors for CTIT-related bleeding. Malignancies associated with reduced platelet counts and additional risk factors require heightened clinical vigilance for hemorrhage development.","28":"No abstract available","29":"<b>Objective:<\/b> To examine the clinical application value of robot-assisted esophageal suspension-traction combined with the \"four-edge\" dissociation in the lymph node dissection of left recurrent laryngeal nerve of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. <b>Methods:<\/b> This is a retrospective case series study. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 127 cases of robot-assisted McKeown minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) with complete medical records and follow-up data, and without neoadjuvant therapy, performed at the Department of Minimally Invasive Esophagus Surgery, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital from January 2022 to December 2024. Among them, there were 116 males and 11 females, aged (63.0\u00b16.0) years (range: 44 to 79 years). There were 13 cases of upper thoracic esophageal cancer, 69 cases of middle thoracic esophageal cancer, and 45 cases of lower thoracic esophageal cancer. The lymph node dissection method in the 106recL station was the en bloc resection for robot-assisted esophageal suspension-traction combined with the \"four-edge\" dissociation. Under the assistance of the robot, the operating space in the left recurrent laryngeal nerve area was increased and exposed by suspending and pulling the esophagus; through dissociating the outer edges of the trachea, esophagus, blood vessels and nerves, the operating space was further released and bloodless was performed, thereby achieving en bloc resection of the soft tissue and lymph nodes in the left recurrent laryngeal nerve area. Statistical methods such as <i>\u03c7<\/i><sup>2<\/sup> test and univariate and multivariate Logistic regression were employed to analyze the relationship between lymph node metastasis in the 106recL station and clinical pathological characteristics. <b>Results:<\/b> Among the 127 cases of robot-assisted McKeown MIE, a total of 508 lymph nodes were dissected in the 106recL station.

The post-procedural ankle-brachial index (ABI) improvement, 6-month clinical-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR)-free rate, 6-month clinical efficacy rate and wound healing rate were collected. The comparison of data among the plain old balloon angioplasty group, drug-coated balloon group, and constrained balloon group was conducted using independent sample <i>t<\/i>-test, one-way analysis of variance, chi square test, and Kruskal Wallis <i>H<\/i> test. Due to the small number of cases in the debulking combined with antiproliferative therapy group, only data description is provided. <b>Results:<\/b> The CD-TLR-free rate of the 117 patients was 85.5% (100\/117), and the 6-month clinical efficacy rate was 72.6% (85\/117). Only one patient in the POBA group underwent above-the-ankle amputation, and there were no deaths. The ABI of the patients in the POBA group, DCB group, and constrained balloon group increased significantly on the first day after surgery compared with that before surgery, and the difference in the increase of ABI was not statistically significant (<i>P<\/i>>0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the 6-month CD-TLR freedom rate and treatment effectiveness rate among the three groups (<i>P<\/i>>0.05). Among patients free from revascularization at 6 months, the increase in ABI at 6 months after surgery in the POBA group was 0.18\u00b10.13, in the DCB group was 0.30\u00b10.08, and in the constrained balloon group was 0.32\u00b10.24, and the difference was statistically significant (<i>F<\/i>=10.955, <i>P<\/i><0.01). Among the patients with Rutherford grade 5 to 6, the wound healing rate in the DCB group was 82.8% (24\/29), which was higher than that in the POBA group (56.5%, 26\/46) (<i>\u03c7<\/i><sup>2<\/sup>=5.509, <i>P<\/i>=0.019), and there was no statistically significant difference compared with the constrained balloon group (61.9%, 13\/21) (<i>\u03c7<\/i><sup>2<\/sup>=2.753, <i>P<\/i>=0.097). The ulcer healing time in the DCB group was (9.0\u00b10.5) weeks, which was shorter than that in the POBA group (13.8\u00b18.9) weeks (<i>t<\/i>=2.636, <i>P<\/i>=0.011) and the constrained balloon group (10.4\u00b11.4) weeks (<i>t<\/i>=4.446, <i>P<\/i><0.01). In the DAART group, the ABI increased by 0.59\u00b10.11 (range: 0.44 to 0.72) on the first day after surgery compared with that before surgery, and by 0.47\u00b10.09 (range: 0.34 to 0.57) at 6 months after surgery. All patients in the DAART group were effectively treated at 6 months after surgery, were CD-TLR-free, and had healed ulcers, with a healing time of (6.6\u00b11.9) weeks (range: 1 to 12 weeks). <b>Conclusions:<\/b> Below-the-ankle artery revascularization may provide a favorable short-term prognosis for chronic limb-threatening ischemia patients. Especially for patients with Rutherford classification 5 to 6, DCB demonstrated higher wound healing rates and shorter healing times within 6 months post-procedure, which may have certain clinical advantages.","33":"This study evaluated cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) using both CMV-PCR and antigenemia assays in 109 adult recipients. CMV-PCR and antigenemia values had a moderate linear correlation. In total, 58 patients exhibited CMV-PCR positivity before starting antigenemia-based preemptive treatment. Excluding the two patients with persistent PCR positivity, the antigenemia value subsequently reached the threshold in 31 of 54 patients. On the other hand, 25 patients had spontaneous clearance of viremia without preemptive treatment. Spontaneous clearance was associated with letermovir use and the absence of graft-versus-host disease. The clinical course of CMV infection was simulated using various CMV-PCR thresholds (range 50-1000\u00a0IU\/mL). In high-risk patients not treated with letermovir, a threshold of 50\u00a0IU\/mL enables preemptive treatment initiation without increasing overtreatment risk in patients with spontaneous clearance. However, in high-risk patients treated with letermovir, thresholds\u2009>\u2009150\u00a0IU\/mL delayed the start of preemptive treatment. In low-risk patients, a threshold of 500-750\u00a0IU\/mL balances avoiding spontaneous resolution and increasing delayed treatment. PCR thresholds of 50 and 150\u00a0IU\/mL may be appropriate for initiating preemptive therapy in high-risk patients treated and not treated with letermovir, respectively, while 500-750\u00a0IU\/mL may be optimal for low-risk patients.","34":"Nasal drug delivery offers several advantages, such as rapid onset and avoidance of hepatic first-pass metabolism, making it a promising option for delivering drugs both locally and systemically. In the early phases of pharmaceutical development, predictive tools for nasal absorption are critical for selecting suitable candidates. This study evaluates the utility of RPMI 2650 cells as an in vitro model for predicting nasal drug absorption. First, we confirmed the reproducibility of membrane permeability across two air-liquid interface culture conditions (shifted on days 1 and 3), demonstrating consistent permeability profiles and agreement with previously reported P<sub>app<\/sub> values. We investigated the correlation between the permeability of RPMI 2650 cells and both clinical nasal bioavailability (nasal BA) and the estimated human nasal fraction absorbed (nasal Fa), revealing good correlations in both cases. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a significant correlation between in vitro permeability and estimated human nasal Fa levels. Although some compounds deviated from the correlation curve, these findings indicate that RPMI 2650 cells are useful in vitro tools for predicting nasal drug absorption during the early phases of pharmaceutical development.","35":"Quality by design (QbD) and design of experiments (DoE) have become central to modern pharmaceutical development, yet most guidance and reviews treat formulation development, process optimization, and process validation as largely separate activities. This narrative review focuses specifically on oral tablet products and traces how formulation-level DoE can be used to systematically define, refine, and confirm design space across the full lifecycle of tablet development. Published case studies are organized along a formulation-to-validation pathway, beginning with the translation of the target product profile (TPP) into tablet-specific quality TPPs and critical quality attributes, followed by risk assessment and the selection of appropriate screening, mixture, and response-surface designs for both formulation and process studies. Subsequent sections highlight how DoE outputs support probabilistic and mechanistic design space definition, scale-up and technology transfer, and the alignment of Stage 1-3 process validation activities with QbD principles. Particular attention is given to challenges in integrating DoE with process analytical technology (PAT), model lifecycle management, and data-driven control strategies. This review synthesizes these elements into a practical framework for tablet scientists and manufacturing teams. We outline ways to embed DoE into QbD-based development for tablets and highlight key gaps, including the limited use of probability-based design spaces and digitally enabled validation.","36":"This study aims to analyze the safety profile of sparsentan in real-world clinical settings using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, providing insights for its clinical application. Data from the FAERS database were collected between the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2024. Adverse events (AEs) associated with sparsentan were identified using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS). The temporal distribution of AEs was further analyzed using the Weibull distribution to comprehensively assess the safety profile of the drug in clinical practice. A total of 1776 reports of AEs were retrieved from the FAERS database, with sparsentan identified as the primary suspect (PS) drug. These AEs were reported across 25 system organ classes (SOCs). Forty-four preferred terms (PTs) were retained by the four algorithms, including well-documented adverse reactions listed on the drug label, such as hypotension, hyperkalemia, peripheral edema, and dizziness. In addition, previously unmentioned potential AEs were identified, including nasopharyngitis, ear discomfort, renal pain, and musculoskeletal chest pain. The median time to onset of sparsentan-associated AEs was 18\u00a0days (IQR 4-60.5\u00a0days), with most events occurring within the first month of treatment. This study provides real-world data on the clinical application of sparsentan and analyzes the AEs associated with its use. It not only confirms several known adverse effects, but also identifies potential new AEs. These findings offer valuable guidance for clinicians prescribing sparsentan, aiding in the reduction of drug-related risks.","37":"Optogenetic vision-restorative approaches have entered the clinical stage of development. This article provides an overview of the current status of translation. It discusses specific aspects relating to the identification of a\u00a0suitable study group and the selection of endpoints. It also focuses on patients' expectations on this novel therapy. A narrative review article is presented. Clinicaltrials.gov lists eight different treatment studies pursuing the approach of optogenetic restoration of vision. The results from three of these have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Now that proof of concept has been successfully demonstrated in patients, future approaches must focus on restoring more complex visual perception in order to offer maximum added value. When identifying suitable patient groups, the status of retinal remodelling must be considered, as must the fact that patients with no remaining native visual impressions already benefit from a\u00a0lower functional gain. Study endpoints should be chosen so that they specifically probe the function of the optogenetic actuator and meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities for treatment approval. Optogenetics has reached the clinical development phase. Following proof of concept, the focus is now on further developing the approach so that it will also enable complex vision.","38":"Mazindol, an imidazo[2,1-a]-isoindole anorectic from the 1970s, has recently re-emerged as a candidate therapy for disorders of arousal and reward dysregulation, due to its unique multimodal receptor profile. Despite its 1999 withdrawal from US\/EU markets, off-label narcolepsy efficacy spurred immediate-release\/sustained-release (IR\/SR) development. Clinical trials demonstrate mazindol IR\/SR efficacy, reducing excessive daytime somnolence and cataplexy in narcolepsy and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) severity symptomatology, with mild adverse events (e.g., dry mouth). Preclinical studies demonstrate potent monoamine transporter inhibition (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin) with minimal dopamine release, reducing abuse liability compared with amphetamines. Novel interactions orexin-2, 5-HT<sub>1A<\/sub>, and mu-opioid receptors suggest reward modulation, low abuse potential, and utility in polydrug dependence (e.g., fentanyl-cocaine co-use). This review, covering the period 1970-2025, emphasizes the potential for repositioning mazindol, including its potential utility in managing opioid-stimulant co-dependence and attention-related disorders, and underscores its relevance for future therapeutic repurposing. Although this is a narrative review, we conducted targeted searches of PubMed, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov from this period of time, using terms including \"mazindol,\" \"narcolepsy,\" \"ADHD,\" and \"substance use disorder.\"","39":"We aimed to describe treatment patterns of patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) who progressed after receiving darolutamide in a real-world setting, and according to the standard clinical practice in Spain. This was a multicenter, observational, retrospective study conducted at the urology and oncology departments of 17 Spanish hospitals that participated in the ARAMIS trial and its rollover study. 85 patients, with a median age of 76\u00a0years, were included in the study. 49 patients (57.6%) progressed to mCRPC, with metastases located mainly in bone. Only 35 of them (71.4%) received at least one subsequent therapy. The most common first-line treatments after darolutamide were abiraterone (n\u2009=\u200922, 63%) and docetaxel (n\u2009=\u200910, 29%), with a median (IQR) treatment duration of 7.6\u00a0months (4.7, 12.7) and 4.8\u00a0months (3.8, 5.8), respectively; besides, the most frequent first-line\/second-line treatment sequences were abiraterone-docetaxel and docetaxel-cabazitaxel. In addition, only 20% of patients with bone metastases received osteoclast-targeted therapy. These real-world practice patterns suggest a lack of consensus in Spanish clinical practice for the management of patients with mCRPC, indicating that there is a need for more standardized strategies and unification of the criteria to make decisions in accordance with the recommendations of international clinical practice guidelines. Not applicable.","40":"Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a mathematical method for predicting drug pharmacokinetics based on individual physiological information, and its usefulness has been attracting attention in recent years. This study aimed to investigate and compare the extent to which PBPK models are utilized in drug package inserts in Japan, the United States, and Europe. We searched the official websites of the PMDA, FDA, and EMA to examine the number and content of drugs that mention the use of PBPK modeling as of 2024. Furthermore, we compared the consistency and detail of the descriptions between Japan, the United States, and Europe. As a result, 38 drugs in Japan listed PBPK modeling, many of which were related to drug-drug interactions. Compared with Europe, there were no complete matches and only seven partial matches, while compared with the United States, there were two complete matches and 24 partial matches. A comparison of the details of the 24 partial matches revealed a tendency for Japanese package inserts to be more detailed. PBPK model analysis has become increasingly important in recent drug development, and Japan in particular has a tendency to provide more detailed information on package inserts. This study suggests the potential for further utilization of PBPK models in the field of clinical pharmacology.","41":"No abstract available","42":"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infection worldwide, disproportionately affecting women and increasingly complicated by the rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The investigation of several approaches to treat UTIs has brought attention to the potential therapeutic benefits of probiotics, especially Lactobacillus species. Human breast milk, a unique reservoir of commensal and beneficial microbes, harbours diverse Lactobacillus strains with demonstrated antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and anti-adhesive properties. The probiotic potential of Lactobacillus strains isolated from human breast milk in the treatment and prevention of UTIs is critically examined. An overview of the clinical burden and epidemiology of UTIs, focusing on the issues related to antibiotic resistance, were discussed. Investigation of how Lactobacillus strains isolated from breast milk provides protection by the generation of antimicrobial metabolites, competition for adhesion sites, host immune response regulation, and uropathogen biofilm disintegration. The most recent data from animal models, in vitro research, and early clinical trials emphasize the potential of treatments such as vaginal formulations, oral supplements, and targeted distribution via nano-encapsulation. Significant information gaps, technological advancements, and future research initiatives were identified to convert these findings into therapies that can be used in future clinical settings. This review highlights breast milk-derived Lactobacillus as a unique and durable probiotic therapy against UTIs in the age of antibiotic resistance by combining microbiological, immunological, and translational aspects.","43":"Ramucirumab, a VEGFR-2-targeting monoclonal antibody, has been widely adopted in the treatment of various solid tumors. However, its safety profile in routine clinical practice remains incompletely understood. To address this, we examined adverse event reports associated with ramucirumab collected in the FAERS database between 2014 and 2024. Following careful deduplication, 3,435 reports were analyzed, identifying 139 Preferred Terms with significant signals across four disproportionality methods. In addition to well-established toxicities such as gastrointestinal perforation, hemorrhage, hypertension, and proteinuria, several previously underrecognized events were detected, including heart failure, chylothorax, and pseudocirrhosis. Gastrointestinal perforation events were particularly frequent and often occurred within the first three months of therapy. Temporal analyses indicated that the early treatment period is critical for the onset of severe adverse events. While the FAERS data cannot confirm causality, these findings underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring, especially during the initial phase of treatment, and highlight areas for further clinical and mechanistic investigation into the safety risks of ramucirumab.","44":"Therapeutic benefits of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroids remain inconclusive in optimizing treatment strategies for acute myocarditis. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane databases, and Web of Science were searched for studies evaluating the effectiveness of adjunctive IVIG, steroids, or both with standard heart failure treatment in pediatric acute myocarditis. A random-effects network meta-analysis was conducted using frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Effect sizes were calculated as risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD). P-scores provided a ranking of treatments. Thirteen studies comprising 2850 participants were involved. Compared with standard treatment, IVIG reduced in-hospital mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.35-0.76), long-term mortality (RR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.27-0.98), overall mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34-0.76), and better composite outcome (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88). IVIG was optimal for reducing in-hospital and overall mortality and improving the composite outcome (P-scores = 0.993, 0.999, 0.986). Steroids or their combination with IVIG showed no significant benefit. IVIG improved cardiac function by increasing left ventricular ejection fraction (MD, 6.00%; 95% CI, 0.94-11.06) and reducing left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (MD, -3.77; 95% CI, -7.02 to -0.52). Integrating IVIG into standard treatment may significantly enhance outcomes in children with complicated acute myocarditis. This systematic review and network meta-analysis addresses the gap between clinical trial efficacy and real-world effectiveness in pediatric clinical practice. This study suggests that adding IVIG to standard heart failure therapy may improve survival and cardiac function in children with acute complicated myocarditis. The routine use of steroids requires the cautious clinical application. High-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to inform guidelines and optimize therapy.","45":"Mucus hypersecretion and accumulation are hallmark features of equine asthma (EA), a meaningful respiratory disorder in horses occurring in mild to moderate (MEA) and severe (SEA) forms. Changes of the proteomic composition of airway mucus in EA are poorly understood. Using label-free quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we analyzed airway mucus from SEA (n\u2009=\u200910), MEA (n\u2009=\u20096), and healthy (n\u2009=\u20098) horses. We identified and quantified 2,275 proteins including gel-forming mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B and membrane-bound mucins MUC1 and MUC4. Compared with healthy controls, 130 proteins (SEA) and 103 (MEA) were significantly increased. 38 were elevated in SEA relative to MEA, 10 were higher in MEA. MUC4 was markedly increased in both, correlated with bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.790, p\u2009=\u20094.9E-06), and distinguished excellently between healthy and asthmatics (AUC\u2009=\u20091.0, 95% CI: 1-1), similar to 23 other proteins. MUC5AC was elevated in both, whereas MUC5B only in SEA. MUC1 did not differ between groups. Changes in mucus-modifying proteins, including glycosyltransferases and aquaporins, suggest altered mucus properties in EA. Functional enrichment analyses revealed inflammation-, tissue remodeling- and coagulation-linked GO terms and pathways in EA. The distinct proteomic profiles add to the understanding of EA and may offer novel targets for phenotype-specific biomarkers and therapy.","46":"Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are over-represented in psychiatric services, and their suicide mortality is markedly higher than that of the general population. This network meta-analysis evaluated and compared the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for symptoms of BPD. A systematic search of Medline\u00ae, Web of Science\u00ae, and Google Scholar\u00ae identified randomised clinical trials comparing active drugs with placebo or another agent between 15 January and 12 February 2024. Standardised mean differences were estimated using random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses. The level of evidence (LoE) for significant drug-placebo comparisons was rated using GRADE NMA guidance. Thirty-five trials including 2551 participants assessed 26 treatments against placebo: 18 had low, five moderate, and 12 high risk of bias. Topiramate (200-250\u2009mg\/day, 8-10 weeks), lamotrigine (50-200\u2009mg\/day, 8 weeks), and aripiprazole (15\u2009mg\/day, 8 weeks) most effectively reduced hostility, aggressiveness, and anger, and improved anger control. Carbamazepine (200-1200\u2009mg\/ day, 6 weeks) and asenapine (5-10\u2009mg\/day, 12 weeks) improved impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, respectively. Topiramate, lamotrigine, and aripiprazole demonstrated high, moderate, and moderate LoE for hostility and anger reduction. Carbamazepine and asenapine demonstrated low and very low LoE for impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. Conversely, alprazolam, methylphenidate, haloperidol, and valproate had only low-certainty evidence in unselected BPD samples and should not be prioritised. Prescription should be limited to specific, individualised indications, such as panic, comorbid ADHD, or transient psychotic features, following cautious clinical appraisal.","47":"Subthreshold depression (StD) confers a high risk for major depression and is characterized by substantial individual clinical heterogeneity. However, the neurobiological substrates underlying this heterogeneity remain largely unknown. Using a large multisite resting-state functional MRI dataset including 1203 healthy participants and 197 individuals with StD, we constructed connectome-based normative models to identify individual brain deviations and biotypes in StD. We highlighted remarkable individual variability in the connectome deviations in StD, leading to the identification of two distinct biotypes. Subtype 1 exhibits severe positive deviations primarily in the default mode regions and negative deviations in the sensorimotor and ventral attention areas, while subtype 2 shows a moderate but opposite deviation pattern. The two subtypes differ significantly in depressive symptoms, gene expression profiles, and treatment responses to bright light therapy. These findings highlight the neurobiological underpinnings of the clinical diversity in StD, emphasizing the necessity for developing personalized interventions for this condition.","48":"No abstract available","49":"No abstract available"},"url":{"0":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668202\/","1":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668201\/","2":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668197\/","3":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668195\/","4":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668193\/","5":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668176\/","6":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668168\/","7":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668166\/","8":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668164\/","9":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668148\/","10":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668125\/","11":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668117\/","12":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668102\/","13":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668089\/","14":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668085\/","15":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668076\/","16":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668074\/","17":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668073\/","18":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668072\/","19":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668046\/","20":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668042\/","21":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668040\/","22":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668037\/","23":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668029\/","24":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41668002\/","25":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667983\/","26":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667974\/","27":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667944\/","28":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667939\/","29":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667931\/","30":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667930\/","31":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667929\/","32":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667927\/","33":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667916\/","34":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667911\/","35":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667904\/","36":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667900\/","37":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667897\/","38":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667893\/","39":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667886\/","40":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667884\/","41":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667882\/","42":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667874\/","43":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667851\/","44":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667850\/","45":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667845\/","46":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667836\/","47":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667835\/","48":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667798\/","49":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667793\/"}}
