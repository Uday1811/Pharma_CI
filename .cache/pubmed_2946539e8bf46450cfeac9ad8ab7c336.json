Understanding patient preferences is crucial for successful and efficient implementation and scaling of LA-ART in resource-limited settings such as Kenya. We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit preferences for LA-ART attributes among PWH in Kenya. We recruited 700 PWH taking daily oral ART from Kenyatta National Hospital and two Sex Workers Outreach Program clinics in Nairobi. In 17 choice scenarios, participants chose between their current daily oral regimen and two hypothetical LA-ART alternatives defined by seven attributes: delivery mode (long-acting oral, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, implant), administration location (clinic, chemist, home), frequency (weekly, every 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12 months), delivery-site pain (none, mild, moderate), pre-treatment viral suppression (required, not required), pre-treatment negative reaction testing (required, not required), and late-dose leeway (short, long). We used conditional logistic regressions with interactions between mode and pain to determine the relative importance in participants' choices across attributes. Participants had a median age of 36 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 28-46); 64% were female, 83% were virally suppressed, 51% were from key populations (e.g., sex workers or men who have sex with men), and median time on ART was 9 years (IQR: 5-15). Participants generally preferred the hypothetical LA-ART options over their current daily oral ART, and the interaction of delivery mode and pain was the most important attribute combination. Oral LA-ART was the most preferred mode; 1-year implants with mild pain was the next preferred option. Participants favored administration at clinics to chemists or home and preferred less frequent dosing. LA-ART would be highly acceptable in Kenya, with oral LA-ART and administration at clinics as the preferred formulation and location. Our findings provide valuable evidence to guide the development of novel LA-ART products. Future research should evaluate preference heterogeneity and investigate ways to effectively scale LA-ART in Kenya and similar settings, while taking into account patient preferences.

However, real-world data on patient satisfaction with the guselkumab One-Press device, particularly in Portuguese clinical practice, are limited. This real-world, prospective, multicenter, nationwide study evaluated patient satisfaction with self-administration of guselkumab using the One-Press device over 52\u00a0weeks in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO. A total of 101 patients from 10 dermatology centers were enrolled between September 2022 and November 2023. Patient satisfaction was assessed using the Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) at baseline and week 20. Using the SIAQ, patients rated the One-Press device's acceptability across six domains predose and postdose (feeling about injections, self-confidence, and satisfaction with self-injection; postdose only: self-image, pain and skin reactions during or after the injection, and ease of self-injection device use). Quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI]), clinical effectiveness (Investigator Global Assessment [IGA]), and safety were evaluated through week 52. Mean SIAQ PRE Module score increased significantly from 6.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 at baseline to 8.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 at week 20 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), indicating improved self-injection experience. Injection-related anxiety decreased from 63.4% to 48.9%. Mean DLQI score improved from 8.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9 at baseline to 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8 at week 20 and 1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0 at week 52; 70.8% of patients achieved DLQI 0\/1 by week 52. Despite nearly 90% having prior biologic or systemic therapy exposure, IGA 0\/1 (\"clear\" or \"almost clear\") was achieved by 86.3% of patients at week 20 and 91.0% at week 52. A total of 198 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 62.4% of patients and were mainly mild, localized injection-site reactions. One serious AE was considered related to guselkumab. In routine clinical practice in Portugal, guselkumab self-administered using the One-Press device demonstrated high patient satisfaction, substantial quality-of-life improvement, robust clinical effectiveness, and a favorable safety profile. These real-world findings support the usability and benefit-risk profile of self-administered guselkumab for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO.","3":"The coronavirus main protease (3CL<sup>pro<\/sup>, M<sup>pro<\/sup>, nsp5) is a highly conserved cysteine protease unique to the Coronaviridae family, including SARS-CoV-2, and is a validated target for the treatment of COVID-19.

We used Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service adjudicated claims within the Innovation in Medical Evidence and Development Surveillance network to identify three new-user cohorts: (1) ertugliflozin; (2) SU\/TZD; and (3) incretin-based drugs. The outcome was a principal hospital discharge diagnosis for DKA. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated after 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching, separately for ertugliflozin vs. SU\/TZD and vs. incretin-based drugs. Subgroup analyses were performed based on baseline insulin use. After PS matching, baseline characteristics were similarly distributed in each cohort. For ertugliflozin (n\u2009=\u200942,907) vs. SU\/TZD (n\u2009=\u200942,907), the incidence rates of DKA per 1000 person-years (PY) were 2.95 and 1.49, respectively. For ertugliflozin (n\u2009=\u200942,247) vs. incretin-based drugs (n\u2009=\u200942,247), the incidence rates of DKA per 1000 PY were 2.76 and 1.06, respectively. For ertugliflozin vs. SU\/TZD, the HR [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 1.88 [1.17-3.02]; in non-insulin users, 2.34 [1.27-4.31]; and in insulin users, 1.17 [0.54-2.52]. For ertugliflozin vs. incretin-based drugs, the HR [95% CI] was 2.40 [1.40-4.11]; in non-insulin users, 2.84 [1.42-5.66]; and in insulin users, 1.87 [0.79-4.46]. Ertugliflozin was associated with a higher risk of DKA relative to comparators. HRs were higher among new users with no-concomitant insulin use than those with concomitant insulin use. Results were consistent with prior SGLT2i data and highlighted the importance of caution by both patients and physicians.","5":"Continuous Direct Compression via Mini-Batch Blending (CDC via MBB) is gaining traction as an innovative manufacturing technology in the pharmaceutical industry. According to the Roche design, mini-batches (MBs) are sequentially fed and blended, remaining separate until they come into contact with one another in the hopper above the tablet press after the first diversion point. Material tracking is crucial for understanding how unexpected disturbances propagate through a CDC via MBB line. While tracking is straightforward for separate MBs, assessing the residence time distribution (RTD) in the tablet press becomes necessary after the first diversion point. In this study, a methodological framework is presented where a RTD was characterized experimentally using a tracer (tartaric acid) step change, transmission Raman spectroscopy and in-silico modelling using Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. The experimental results indicated intermixing between adjacent MBs. The RTD-based simulations enabled the quantification of intermixing, revealing that the produced tablet consisted of a blend of multiple MBs at any given time during the characterization of the tablet press. Further simulations based on the corroborated RTD enabled testing of the sampling and disturbance management strategies. The RTD models were used to compare conservative and smart material diversion strategies. It was established that the smart strategy significantly reduced the amount of non-conforming material after minor disturbances. Understanding the process dynamics based on the RTD characterization of the tablet press allows for the development of sampling and material diversion strategies during the CDC via MBB drug product process development. Insights from this work can be applied to other tablet press variants as discussed in Part 2 of this study.","6":"Rapid symptom relief is an important consideration for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) experiencing a flare. Etrasimod is an oral, once-daily, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,4,5 receptor modulator for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC. We evaluated patient-reported symptomatic improvement from patients in the ELEVATE UC program. This study was a post-hoc analysis of pooled daily e-diary data from patients with moderately to severely active UC receiving etrasimod or placebo in the phase III ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 trials. During the 12-week induction periods, patients self-reported stool frequency and rectal bleeding on days 1-28. Daily symptomatic response and symptomatic remission were calculated (partial modified Mayo Score). Overall, 787 patients (527 receiving etrasimod, 260 placebo) were included in the analysis. Etrasimod-treated patients had statistically significantly higher rates of symptomatic response and symptomatic remission during the first 28\u2009days of therapy, with adjusted differences (95% CIs) reaching statistical significance from day 2 (5.6% [0.8-10.3], P\u2009=\u2009.022) to day 11 (4.7% [0.4-9.0], P\u2009=\u2009.034), respectively. In patients na\u00efve to biologic\/Janus kinase inhibitor therapy, symptomatic response was statistically significantly improved with etrasimod vs placebo from day 3 (8.9% [2.3-15.5], P\u2009=\u2009.008). Symptomatic improvement rates were similar with and without concomitant corticosteroid use. In this post-hoc analysis, improvements in UC symptoms occurred in patients receiving etrasimod vs placebo from as early as day 2. These findings indicate a rapid onset of symptomatic effect with etrasimod treatment for moderately to severely active UC.

Inhibition of these transporters can increase the plasma exposure of a co-administered drug by reducing its renal clearance, potentially resulting in clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The ICH M12 guideline promotes the use of endogenous substrates as biomarkers offers a promising approach for assessing transporter inhibition during early-phase clinical studies, potentially reducing reliance on traditional probe-based DDI trials. This strategy may reduce or eliminate the need for dedicated DDI studies using exogenous probe substrates, thereby streamlining drug development and advancing precision medicine. This review provides an overview of the discovery, evaluation, and application of renal transporter biomarkers-specifically endogenous metabolites-in the context of transporter-mediated DDI risk assessment. We highlight the use of in vitro and in vivo models, including transporter-overexpressing cell systems, knockout mice, and clinical DDI samples, to identify and validate biomarkers for renal transporters. Human genetic studies further support biomarker discovery by linking transporter variants to metabolite levels. Analytical tools like targeted and untargeted metabolomic approaches are essential for biomarker identification and quantification. Additionally, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is discussed as a critical tool for translating biomarker data into clinical DDI predictions.","8":"This post hoc subgroup analysis was conducted using pooled data from three US-based clinical trials to compare efficacy and safety of rimegepant 75\u2009mg versus placebo in acute migraine in adults who are Black or African American. Migraine, characterized by recurring moderate-to-severe unilateral head pain, affects approximately 13% of the population and in the United States affects Black or African American and White populations at similar rates. Despite this, there is stark underrepresentation of Black or African American patients in clinical trials. Rimegepant, an oral small molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blocker or antagonist, is approved for acute migraine treatment in the United States; however, treatment has not previously been analyzed in Black or African American adults. Using pooled data from three US-based, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03235479; NCT03237845; NCT03461757), efficacy analyses were conducted on a modified intent-to-treat population including all participants who received study medication, had a migraine attack of moderate or severe pain intensity at the time of dosing, and provided \u22651 efficacy datapoint after receiving study treatment. Trials were conducted July 2017 to January 2018 (NCT03235479, NCT03237845) or February 2018 to October 2018 (NCT03461757). The coprimary efficacy endpoints of each trial were freedom from pain (score 0\u2009=\u2009none on a 4-point pain scale) and freedom from most bothersome symptom (MBS) at 2\u2009h post dose. Safety was assessed through reported on-treatment adverse events, defined as events occurring on or after treatment was received. Analyses were performed in the Black or African American population, in the White population, and in the overall pooled study population (including Black or African American, White, Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and multiple races). Overall, 3551 treated participants were in the pooled population; 696 (19.6%) were Black or African American; 2700 (76.0%) were White. In the Black or African American population, rimegepant showed improvements versus placebo in the two coprimary endpoints. For pain freedom 2\u2009h post dose, the stratified risk was 24.4% (88\/359) for rimegepant and 18.2% (59\/323) for placebo in Black or African American participants; risk difference was 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1, 12.3; p\u2009=\u20090.047). For MBS freedom 2\u2009h post dose, the stratified risk was 43.1% (155\/359) for rimegepant and 35.5% (115\/323) for placebo in Black or African American participants; risk difference was 7.6% (95% CI: 0.3, 14.9; p\u2009=\u20090.041). The risk difference was similar in White participants: 7.9% (95% CI: 5.2, 10.6; p\u2009<\u20090.001) for pain freedom 2\u2009h post dose and 9.9% (95% CI: 6.5, 13.4; p\u2009<\u20090.001) for MBS freedom 2\u2009h post dose. Adverse event rates among Black or African American participants treated with rimegepant were 10.7% (39\/365) and 7.9% (26\/331) in participants receiving placebo. This pooled analysis showed rimegepant 75\u2009mg was effective and well tolerated for migraine treatment in Black or African American adult participants.","9":"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects up to 1 in 8 individuals over their lifetime and is characterized by an intense fear of social situations involving unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny. This retrospective observational study reviewed published literature from PubMed and analyzed data from Reddit using social media listening (SML) to understand the lived experience of individuals with SAD. SML offers a complement to traditional methods such as semi-structured interviews, particularly for individuals for whom interacting with strangers is challenging. A stepwise analysis, aligned with US Food and Drug Administration Patient-Focused Drug Development guidelines, was performed to develop a conceptual model for SAD focused on adolescents and young adults. A conceptual model provides a visual overview of the interrelationships between disease-related symptoms and their impact from patients' perspective. Natural language processing techniques and machine learning approaches were employed to extract symptoms and impacts from SML posts. After a targeted literature search, eleven qualitative research publications and 535,544 posts from 118,040 Reddit users were included. Clinical and patient experts then confirmed the content in the conceptual model covering three key symptom domains (physical, negative automatic thoughts, and emotions) and two impact domains (social functioning and occupational\/educational functioning). This study captures the value of SML by eliciting spontaneous insights that may not emerge in traditional approaches and proposes a comprehensive conceptual model to support future research and the optimization of Clinical Outcome Assessments in SAD clinical trials.","10":"Acquired resistance (AR) to immunotherapy following initial response occurs frequently in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (mNSCLC). We developed and validated easy-to-apply prognostic score models to identify patients with mNSCLC at greater risk of AR to frontline (1L) anti-programmed cell death protein 1\/programmed death-ligand 1 [anti-PD-(L)1] therapy. Electronic health records of patients with mNSCLC who responded to 1L anti-PD-(L)1 (diagnosed 2015-2023) in the ConcertAI Patient360\u2122 database were analyzed. Multivariable Cox models (monotherapy versus combination) assessing association between baseline prognostic factors and real-world duration of response (rwDoR) were used to develop prognostic scores and stratify patients into low- and high-risk groups. Risk stratification was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves, performance metrics, and decision curves. External validation utilized the COTA NSCLC dataset. The majority of patients (<i>n<\/i> = 3181) did not respond to anti-PD-(L)1, leaving 1891 1L immunotherapy-responding patients (94% partial responders, 6% complete responders), with a median (interquartile range) time from anti-PD-(L)1 initiation to first response of 2.5 months (1.84-3.19 months). Across the monotherapy and combination therapy cohorts, median rwDOR was significantly shorter in high-risk (7.6 and 5.2 months) versus low-risk groups (18.9 and 12.0 months), suggesting model differentiation. Decision curves were above reference lines at predicted AR probabilities 180-day after initial response (monotherapy: 35.5%; combination therapy: 45.4%) corresponding to the cut-off for high-risk patients, indicating greater net benefits when employing risk grouping. External dataset validation demonstrated that model-based risk grouping significantly distinguished rwDOR and exhibited consistent performance metrics. Proposed prognostic score models may facilitate identifying patient subsets at higher risk of AR to 1L anti-PD-(L)1.","11":"The therapeutic landscape in multiple myeloma (MM) is rapidly evolving; however, a significant unmet need remains for patients with relapsed or refractory (RR) MM in Saudi Arabia. Although chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies for myeloma have received approval in the region, their accessibility remains limited, and many patients are ineligible due to factors such as advanced age, comorbidities, rapidly progressive disease, or logistical barriers. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are emerging as a promising option in Saudi Arabia, but the paucity of region-specific clinical evidence underscores the critical need for tailored, evidence-based guidance to optimize their application in clinical practice. A group of experts in MM based in Saudi Arabia convened to align on optimal use of BsAbs in clinical practice based on their experience and evidence from a literature analysis. A modified Delphi methodology with prespecified acceptance threshold of \u226570% was used to generate expert recommendations. Agreement was achieved in 30 of 35 statements (86%) across four broad areas: patient selection, sequencing and dosing, monitoring, and efficacy outcomes. Experts agreed that BsAbs should be positioned in triple-class refractory MM. Positive clinical trial outcomes observed with BsAbs, including high overall response rates, prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival underscore the importance of selecting BsAbs with proven efficacy. While CAR T-cell therapy is only recently approved for MM in Saudi Arabia, BsAbs are preferred for patients with rapidly progressing disease due to CAR T-cell product manufacturing delays. BsAbs are an effective treatment option for those with triple-class refractory MM and this manuscript provides a framework to support their optimal use in Saudi Arabia.","12":"Immune checkpoint inhibitor-based combinations have become the standard of care for treatment-naive metastatic renal cell carcinoma <b>(<\/b>mRCC). Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) monotherapy, however, may remain an option particularly for patients with a favourable International Metastatic Database Consortium (IMDC) risk. APOLON is a non-interventional, multicentric prospective study with mRCC patients receiving frontline pazopanib treatment, designed to assess progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate, tolerability, and subsequent post-pazopanib therapy sequences. The 217 patients were 71.0% male, with a median age of 69.6 years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status \u22652 in 17.6%, and mRCC with a favourable (27.1%), intermediate (52.1%) or poor (20.8%) IMDC score. Metastases were mainly located in lung (64.1%), bone (28.6%), mediastinal (18%)\/abdominal (17.1%) lymph nodes. Median PFS was 10.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 9-12.5 months], similarly in patients aged <65 years with PFS 11.3 months (95% CI 6.8-16.1 months) and aged \u226565 years with PFS 10.1 months (95% CI 9.0-12.4 months). The median PFS was 17.1 months (95% CI 9.9-23.2 months), 12.5 months (95% CI 9.0-15.4 months) and 6.2 months (95% CI 3.5-9.5 months) in patients with a favourable, intermediate, and poor IMDC score, respectively. The median OS was 29.1 months (95% CI 24.3-41.3 months). Objective response rate was 48.3% with a complete response in 6 (3.5%) and a partial response in 77 patients (44.8%). Grade 3\/4 adverse events were reported in 45.8% of patients. No safety signals were newly identified. The APOLON study confirmed pazopanib effectiveness and safety in patients with mRCC in a real-world setting. The efficacy remained significant in patients aged \u226565 years and was highly associated with the risk score.","13":"Ritlecitinib is an oral JAK3\/TEC family kinase inhibitor approved for individuals aged\u2009\u2265\u200912\u2009years with severe alopecia areata. Here we report interim efficacy and safety results with ritlecitinib up to Month 24 in the Asian subpopulation from the ALLEGRO phase 2b\/3 and ALLEGRO-LT studies. Data are reported for participants with Severity of Alopecia Tool score\u2009\u2265\u200950 who received ritlecitinib 50\u2009mg with (200\/50-mg group) or without (50-mg group) an initial 4-week 200-mg daily loading dose in ALLEGRO-2b\/3, and continued ritlecitinib 50 mg in ALLEGRO-LT. In long-term studies, it is common for summaries at later time points to reflect participants who remained in the study, tolerated the drug, and had a positive treatment response. To account for this, efficacy summaries were presented both as observed and by using the last observation carried forward method. At Month 12, 51.7% and 44.7% (last observation carried forward) of Asian participants in the 50-mg (n\u2009=\u200958) and 200\/50-mg groups (n\u2009=\u200947), respectively, achieved Severity of Alopecia Tool score\u2009\u2264\u200920 (\u2264\u200920% scalp hair loss); the respective proportions were 50.0% and 47.8% at Month 24. Of participants who achieved Severity of Alopecia Tool score\u2009\u2264\u200920 at Month 12 in the 50-mg and 200\/50-mg groups, 68.2% and 86.7% sustained this response through Month 24, respectively. At Month 12, 74.0% and 57.9% of participants in the 50-mg and 200\/50-mg groups, respectively, had an eyebrow hair regrowth response; at Month 24, the proportions were 72.0% and 48.7%. At Month 12, 65.1% and 54.1% of participants in the 50-mg and 200\/50-mg groups, respectively, had an eyelash hair regrowth response; the proportions were 65.1% and 52.8% at Month 24. The proportion of participants with a Patients' Global Impression of Change response of \"moderately\" or \"greatly\" improved since baseline increased through Month 24 in both groups. Ritlecitinib had an acceptable safety profile, consistent with that in the overall population. Overall, ritlecitinib 50\u2009mg (\u00b1200-mg loading dose) demonstrated clinically meaningful and sustained efficacy through Month 24 in the Asian subpopulation, consistent with results in the overall population. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04006457.","14":"Neoantigen-based adoptive T cell therapies (ACTs) represent a promising avenue in cancer immunotherapy due to their exquisite tumor specificity. The first cell-based immunotherapy for a solid tumor, comprising tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, recently received FDA approval. Building on this, we designed a distinct ACT approach, where T cell responses against personalized neoantigens are systematically generated from autologous peripheral blood. Here we report the establishment of NEO-STIM, an ex vivo induction process to prime and expand pre-existing memory and de novo CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cell responses, thereby highlighting critical parameters for generating potent neoantigen-specific T cell responses. The drug products comprise mutant-reactive, polyfunctional, and cytotoxic CD8<sup>+<\/sup> and CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T cells, able to recognize autologous tumor material. Following infusion, T cell responses are detected in tumor and blood of a patient, and display activated\/exhausted and cytotoxic phenotypes.

We report the results of a sub-group analysis of enrolled Japanese patients. Patients were randomized 1:1 to tisotumab vedotin or investigator-choice chemotherapy (topotecan [nogitecan hydrochloride], vinorelbine, gemcitabine, irinotecan, or pemetrexed). The primary end point was overall survival. Among 502 randomized patients, 101 were Japanese (tisotumab vedotin, n = 50; chemotherapy, n = 51). With 13.7 months of median follow-up in Japanese patients, median overall survival was 15.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.7 to not estimable) with tisotumab vedotin and 8.5 months (95% CI 6.8 to 10.6) with chemotherapy, representing a 55% lower risk of death with tisotumab vedotin than chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.77). Median progression-free survival was 4.0 months (95% CI 3.0 to 4.4) with tisotumab vedotin and 2.0 months (95% CI 1.5 to 3.0) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.95). The confirmed objective response rate was 24.0% (95% CI 13.1 to 38.2) with tisotumab vedotin and 2.0% (95% CI 0.0 to 10.4) with chemotherapy. All patients in the tisotumab vedotin and chemotherapy arms had \u22651 treatment-emergent adverse event; grade \u22653 events occurred in 42.9% and 66.0%, respectively. Six patients (12.2%) discontinued tisotumab vedotin due to treatment-emergent adverse events. Consistent with global findings, tisotumab vedotin resulted in clinical improvement compared with chemotherapy across all efficacy end points, and demonstrated a manageable adverse event profile in Japanese patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.","16":"Vasculopathy and fibrosis are central to the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc) and their genetic underpinnings are largely unknown. Here, we sought to examine the aetiology of severe vascular phenotypes and poorer outcomes in African American (AA) patients with SSc. The study focuses on AA patients with SSc who have more severe vascular phenotypes and poorer outcomes and combines genetics, single-cell RNA sequencing, functional assays, and a mouse model to explore the role of NOTCH4 in SSc vasculopathy and the potential for NOTCH4-directed therapies. Gene-based testing identified NOTCH4 association at an exome-wide significance with SSc (P = 1.6 \u00d7 10<sup>-7<\/sup>) and patients with severe vascular disease (P = 3.5 \u00d7 10<sup>-7<\/sup>). The risk haplotype defined by the missense (c.2824C>T) and promoter (c.-117G>A) variants was enriched in AAs with SSc (11%) vs controls, and the population attributable risk due to this haplotype in AAs with SSc was 2.6%, which was 52-fold higher than in European Americans. The SSc-associated NOTCH4 variants increased NOTCH4 expression and signalling, leading to decreased angiogenesis and increased endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Nailfold capillary abnormalities, decreased angiogenesis, and fibrosis of the vascular lumen are commonly seen in SSc. Genetic, chemical, antibody, or Food and Drug Administration-approved drug inhibition of NOTCH4 signalling rescued angiogenesis and returned EndoMT to baseline. NOTCH4 variants are associated with SSc pathogenesis and vasculopathy, partly explaining the increased prevalence of SSc in AAs. The study highlights the need for further research and clinical trials in the inhibition of the NOTCH4 pathway as a strategy to treat the vascular and fibrotic manifestations of SSc.","17":"Richter's transformation (RT) to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive lymphoma arising from underlying chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). RT is often chemorefractory, with resultant poor clinical outcomes with standard chemoimmunotherapy. Mosunetuzumab, a bispecific CD20\/CD3 T-cell engaging antibody, was investigated in a cohort of 20 patients with relapsed\/refractory RT. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 65%, almost exclusively grade 1 (20%) or 2 (40%) and occurring during the first treatment cycle. Other adverse events included infections, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, tumor flare and low grade neurotoxicity, with no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. Mosunetuzumab resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) 40% and complete response rate (CR) 20%. CRs were durable, with 2 patients experiencing CR >20 months without further therapy, and 2 able to proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplant in CR, with no subsequent relapse. Median progression free and overall survival (PFS and OS) was 3.4 and 10.2 months respectively. Given the favorable toxicity profile of mosunetuzumab, and rapid and durable complete responses observed in this cohort, further investigation of mosunetuzumab for the treatment of RT, as monotherapy and in combination with other novel agents or chemotherapy, is warranted.

It has demonstrated efficacy in phase 3 trials, leading to approval in multiple countries, including the U.S., Japan, and South Korea. In our post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study, we evaluated the safety and effectiveness of InO in adults with R\/R B-ALL based on approximately 5 years of PMS data. A prospective, observational, multicenter PMS study was conducted in Korea to evaluate the real-world safety and effectiveness of InO in adult patients with R\/R B-ALL (NCT04307134). A total of 107 patients were included in the safety analysis, with a median treatment duration of 43.0 days and a median of 2.0 InO cycles. Common adverse events (AEs) were hematologic (58.9%), infectious (50.5%), and gastrointestinal (45.8%), with neutropenia (27.1%) and febrile neutropenia (26.2%) among the most frequent. Serious AEs occurred in 31.8% of patients, most commonly infections such as septic shock (6.5%) and pneumonia (4.7%). Veno-occlusive disease was observed in 2.8% of patients. In the effectiveness analysis set (<i>N<\/i>\u2009=\u200994), median progression-free survival was 3.6 months (95% CI: 3.0\u20134.7 months), overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI: 6.0\u2013NA months), and duration of remission was 3.8 months. (95% CI: 3.0\u20135.4 months). These findings support the clinical utility and safety profile of InO in Korean patients with R\/R B-ALL, reflecting real-world outcomes.

Evaluating patient-related outcomes (PROs) is necessary to assess the impact of therapeutic interventions in preventive therapy. An exploratory analysis of data from the EMPOwER study examined the effect of erenumab on PROs in patients with episodic migraine (EM) in regions underrepresented in the pivotal Phase 3 trials of erenumab, specifically Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Patients (N = 900) were randomized (2:3:3) to receive monthly subcutaneous injections of erenumab 140 mg, erenumab 70 mg, or placebo. Adjusted mean changes from baseline in the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (MPFID), modified Migraine Disability Assessment (mMIDAS), and EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level scale (EQ-5D-5L) scores were assessed during the double-blind treatment phase of 3 months. A statistically significant reduction from baseline in the HIT-6 total score was observed for erenumab 140 mg (-9.34, <i>p<\/i> < 0.001) and 70 mg (-8.39, <i>p<\/i> = 0.004) vs placebo (-6.62) at Month 3. Improvement in MPFID scores was also greater in the erenumab groups vs the placebo group (Everyday Activity: 140 mg, -5.61 [<i>p<\/i> = 0.002]; 70 mg, -4.94 [<i>p<\/i> = 0.011]; placebo, -3.19; Physical Impairment: 140 mg, -4.27 [<i>p<\/i> = 0.014]; 70 mg, -3.95 [<i>p<\/i> = 0.021]; placebo, -2.31) at Month 3. Similar findings were observed for mMIDAS scores (140 mg -8.99 [<i>p<\/i> < 0.001], 70 mg -8.11 [<i>p<\/i> = 0.011] vs placebo [-6.59]) and the EQ-5D-5L quality-of-life visual analog scale scores (140 mg 8.13 [<i>p<\/i> = 0.017], 70 mg 7.08 [<i>p<\/i> = 0.088] vs placebo [5.22]), although no meaningful between-group difference was noted for index values. Erenumab showed favorable effects on PROs when compared with placebo in patients with EM. These results enhance the evidence for erenumab as an effective preventive therapy for patients with EM. Clinicaltrials.gov\/study\/NCT03333109.","20":"Massively-multitask regression models (MMRMs) have revolutionized activity prediction for drug discovery. MMRMs trained on millions of compounds and many thousands of assays can predict bioactivity with accuracy comparable to 4-concentration IC<sub>50<\/sub> experiments. This report compares six MMRMs: pQSAR, Alchemite, MT-DNN, MetaNN, Macau and IMC. Models were trained by experts in each method, on identical sets of 159 kinase and 4276 diverse ChEMBL assays, employing realistically novel training\/test set splits. Results were compared both qualitatively and with statistical rigor. Our use-case is imputing full bioactivity profiles for the very sparse compound collections on which the models were trained. MMRMs performed much better than the single-task random forest regression (ST-RFR) model. Five MMRMs train all models simultaneously, so must leave out test-set measurements from all assays to avoid leakage (here 25% of data), whereas one method trains models one-at-a-time, so only holds out test data for that assay (<\u20091% of data). Thus, all algorithms were compared both using 75\/25 splits, and when possible, 99\u2009+\u2009\/\u2009<\u20091 splits. Many MMRM evaluations achieved similar accuracy when tested on the same split. However, when evaluated on 75\/25 splits, all MMRMs performed much worse than when evaluated on 99\u2009+\u2009\/\u2009<\u20091% splits. Thus, while many MMRMs produce comparable final production models (trained on all the data), models that require 75\/25 splits greatly underestimate the accuracy of the final models. While outstanding for imputations, MMRMs proved little better than ST-RFR for compounds very unlike the training collection. Thus, MMRMs are best for hit-finding, off-target, promiscuity, MoA, polypharmacology or drug-repurposing within the training collection. Since accuracy is not a deciding factor, other pros and cons of each method are also described.","21":"Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a novel target for antipsychotic and potentially mood-stabilizing and anti-addictive drugs, offering a new mechanism by modulating dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission. TAAR1 agonists from a prior amino oxazolines series were studied preclinically and clinically, but development of partial agonist RO5263397 was halted due to poor metabolization by N-glucuronidation in individuals with UGT2B10 splice site mutations. A medicinal chemistry program subsequently identified new potent and selective TAAR1 ligands from the morpholine series. Two selective partial agonists, RO6799477 and RO6889450, were advanced and showed antipsychotic, stress-response-modulating, and anti-addictive-like activity in rodent models. They reduced PCP- and cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion, potentiated olanzapine's effect, partially reversed cocaine-induced facilitation of intracranial self-stimulation and demonstrated anxiolytic-like properties in the stress-induced hyperthermia test. Neural activation profiles, measured by pharmacological MRI, differed from first and second-generation antipsychotics. Non-clinical drug abuse liability studies with RO6889450 indicated a favorable low abuse liability profile and suggested a lack of reinforcing effects. Preclinical safety studies indicated a favorable profile with clinically monitorable and reversible findings. Both compounds progressed into Phase I single and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy volunteers. RO6799477 was well tolerated, with rapid absorption and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, though higher doses led to nervous system and cardiovascular adverse events. RO6889450 was well tolerated up to 300\u2009mg; at 450\u2009mg, dose-limiting adverse events included postural tachycardia and erythema. Together, these results indicate the translational potential and support further clinical exploration of TAAR1 agonists as a novel therapeutic option for neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia and substance use disorder.","22":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Combination therapy targeting multiple pathways has been shown to improve clinical outcomes. The INSPECTIO study was a prospective, multicenter, observational study conducted across 29 Italian centers specializing in PAH management. The study sought to explore the impact of combination therapy on disease progression and quality of life, by assessing non-invasive risk parameters, echocardiographic and hemodynamic conditions, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Patients with PAH at low or intermediate mortality risk, treated with macitentan and\/or selexipag (as monotherapy or in combination), were enrolled. Data on non-invasive low-risk criteria (WHO Functional Class, 6-min walk distance [6MWD], and NT-proBNP), REVEAL risk scores, echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters, and patient-reported outcomes (emPHasis-10) were collected at baseline and 12\u00a0months. A Narrative Medicine analysis complemented quantitative findings by exploring patients' experiences. Among 176 patients with follow-up data, the number of non-invasive low-risk criteria increased by an average of 0.15 at 12\u00a0months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0167). REVEAL 2.0 and REVEAL Lite 2 scores showed significant reductions (mean changes: -1.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0142; -0.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0111, respectively). Modest changes were observed in echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters. Narrative analysis highlighted strengthened patient-provider relationships and improved coping strategies. Safety outcomes aligned with known profiles. The INSPECTIO study supports the effectiveness of guideline-directed therapy and regular risk assessment to optimize treatment strategies in PAH. The increase in non-invasive low-risk criteria suggests a stabilization of disease over 12\u00a0months.","23":"VCAR33, a donor-derived CD33-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product, was developed to decrease relapse of high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). We describe pre-clinical characterization of the VCAR33 construct, which was optimized for long-term anti-tumor surveillance based on killing and persistence assays. Prior to its use in post-alloHCT maintenance, we evaluated safety and efficacy of VCAR33 in a phase 1\/2 clinical study for adults with relapsed or measurable residual disease (MRD)-positive CD33+ AML\/MDS after alloHCT. Fifteen patients received VCAR33 across 2 arms stratified by disease burden: 7 patients in Arm A (bone marrow blasts \u2265 5%) at dose level 1 (DL1; 1 x 106 CAR+ T cells\/kg) and 8 patients in Arm B (bone marrow blasts < 5%) at DL1 (n=5) and DL2 (3 x 106 CAR+ T cells\/kg; n=3). The study ended for non-safety reasons before escalation to DL3 (1 x 107 CAR+ T cells\/kg) and maximum tolerated dose was not determined. The most common treatment-related adverse event was cytokine release syndrome (93.3%; all < grade 3). Four patients (26.7%) experienced immune cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (1 \u2265 grade 3) and 1 patient (6.7%) had grade III acute graft-versus-host disease within 28 days of VCAR33 infusion. Fourteen patients (93.3%) had transient VCAR33 expansion. Overall response rate was 20%: 2 patients had complete remission with incomplete count recovery in Arm A and 1 Arm B patient achieved MRD clearance. This allogeneic CAR T product demonstrated acceptable safety and preliminary anti-leukemic activity.

The objective of this report is to describe an integrated clinician and specialty pharmacy service model in IBD care to inspire other health systems to adopt similar approaches that could enhance patient care. Multidisciplinary and integrated models of care for patients with IBD have been shown to improve patient outcomes and enhance quality of care. Specifically, pharmacists have demonstrated their ability to provide patient education, prevent interruptions to IBD therapy, improve medication adherence, and improve medication access. Ochsner Health System has developed a system for integrated pharmacy services with the Ochsner specialty pharmacy (OSP) and the Ochsner IBD clinic-based pharmacists. The OSP and IBD clinic-based pharmacists provide comprehensive services to patients with IBD, including medication evaluation for clinical appropriateness, patient education, benefits investigation and financial assistance, and appropriate monitoring of therapy once treatment is started. These services have demonstrated high rates of medication adherence, with the average proportion of days covered at 84.6%, and have expanded patient services within the IBD clinic. Integrated pharmacy services enhance patient care by improving therapy access, adherence, and monitoring. With the continued growth of specialty medications, adoption of integrated clinic pharmacy practice models and specialty pharmacies should be prioritized by health systems, clinics, and payers. These approaches cultivate multidisciplinary patient care and address the complex needs of individuals with IBD.","25":"Romania's healthcare system struggles with the EU's highest rates of treatable and preventable mortality and the lowest per capita health expenditure. Critical issues include unsustainable financing, an entrenched physician-centered model lacking institutional accountability, delayed digitalization, and inadequate clinical research capacity, necessitating structural and paradigmatic shifts. The objective of this study was to synthesize multi-stakeholder consensus recommendations for comprehensive reform of the Romanian healthcare system, focusing on financing, service delivery, and human resources. This manuscript details recommendations from a multi-stakeholder consensus conference organized in April 2025 by the Aspen Institute Romania. Participants addressed topics including financing, patient-centered hospital models, clinical research, health innovation, and the European Health Data Space (EHDS). Consensus recommendations include: stabilizing national health insurance funds (broadened contributions, multi-year budgets); shifting hospitals to patient-centered, institutionally accountable models (transparent allocation, digital integration, eradicating informal payments); equitable hospital reimbursement (unified tariffs); accelerated digital transformation (EHDS alignment, national Electronic Health Record); enhanced clinical trial capacity (personnel, infrastructure, regulatory efficiency); and exploring regulated dual practice, contingent on successful prior reforms. Key challenges include transforming hospital culture, promoting digital adoption, and navigating the complexities of politics and finance. These interconnected recommendations form a roadmap for transformative reform, crucial given the untenable status quo. Success requires sustained political will, stakeholder collaboration, investment, and robust governance to create a financially stable, patient-centered, equitable, and innovative system.","26":"Chemotherapy is the main treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); yet 30-40% of patients are considered relapsed or refractory (R\/R) to initial therapy and have second-line therapy (2\u2009L). There is a need to study real-world outcomes to address the changing treatment landscape for R\/R DLBCL patients. This study examined treatment patterns, healthcare utilization and costs, and survival among Medicare R\/R DLBCL patients from 2016 to 2022. Study patients (<i>n<\/i>\u2009=\u20093,191) were an average of 75.7 years old and only 30.6% of patients initiated 3\u2009L. Patients with 3\u2009L incurred higher costs ($15,133 per-patient per-month [PPPM]) than all patients ($9,487 PPPM). Half of patients died within 6.7 months from start of 2\u2009L. Patients with older age and elevated comorbidity burden had significantly shorter survival times within 3 years after 2\u2009L initiation. Our analyses indicate a high disease burden among R\/R DLBCL patients, highlighting the need for new treatments.","27":"Urine is a dynamic and highly variable biofluid. Urine-urothelium interactions are a critical yet underexplored factor in bladder homoeostasis and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Here, we report on a human 'mini-bladder' model that exposes a stratified urothelium to urine of defined composition, and incorporates micturition. Prolonged exposure to high-solute concentration urine weakens tight junctions, dysregulates immune responses, and reduces bladder tissue resilience. This increases susceptibility to colonisation of the bladder by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) which reduces efficacy of antibiotic therapy. In high-solute concentration urine, Fosfomycin monotherapy - prescribed for uncomplicated UTIs, induces the formation of cell wall-deficient (CWD) UPEC in the urine (as observed in patients with recurrent UTIs) but also within deeper urothelial layers. Tissue-associated CWD UPEC directly contributes to recurrence. Our findings expand the conceptual role for CWD UPEC in UTIs, and demonstrate the power of the mini-bladder platform to capture urine-urothelial microenvironment dynamics that actively shape UTI pathogenesis and antibiotic tolerance.","28":"No abstract available","29":"The ARCHES trial (NCT02677896) showed improved radiographic progression-free survival (primary analysis; 2018) and overall survival (prespecified analysis; 2021) with enzalutamide versus placebo, with concomitant androgen-deprivation therapy, in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) patients. This post hoc analysis describes 5-yr efficacy and safety for all 1150 randomized patients (data cutoff: July 31, 2024). Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive enzalutamide or placebo (first patient randomized: March 21, 2016). After the primary analysis, ARCHES was unblinded (December 10, 2018); 65% and 32% of patients in the enzalutamide and placebo groups, respectively, enrolled in the open-label extension. After the 61.4-mo median follow-up, 5-yr survival probability was 66% with enzalutamide and 53% with placebo (median months not reached in either group; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58, 0.85; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; adjusted HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.75). Patients with high-volume disease who received enzalutamide lived 36\u00a0mo longer than those who received placebo (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.88). No new safety signals emerged. As this was a post hoc, non-alpha protected analysis, the overall survival p value is nominal and should be interpreted cautiously. Overall, this study provides compelling long-term data demonstrating survival benefits with enzalutamide across diverse patient subgroups to guide clinical decision-making and establish prognostic expectations in the mHSPC setting.","30":"Despite growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), many laboratory professionals lack experience with developing in-house AI systems or implementing those supplied by external providers. The IFCC Committee on AI in Laboratory Medicine (C-AILM) conducted a\u00a0survey to collect the status of AI\/ML applications, challenges, and\u00a0expert perspectives on key technical considerations. An 20-item survey was distributed to laboratory professionals experienced in AI. It covered application status (in-house or provider-supplied, with or without regulatory approval); essential information to request from AI system providers; validation or verification practices; monitoring strategies; and perceived implementation challenges. Fifty complete responses from global experts were received. AI implementation in clinical laboratories was limited and heterogeneous. Most respondents agreed that AI systems provided externally, regardless of regulatory approval status, require local verification. Key information needed from providers included performance metrics from\u00a0original and external datasets, and demographics of the training\/test populations. For both approved and non-approved models, high-priority verification studies were local performance analysis, confirmation of intended-use alignment, and verification of privacy and security safeguards. Top monitoring strategies were regular accuracy checks and comparison against human decision-making. Leading challenges were insufficient IT infrastructure and lack of practical implementation guidelines. Although many challenges remain, clinical laboratories demonstrate strong enthusiasm for AI, particularly with\u00a0the growing prevalence of commercial AI products. The\u00a0timely expert insights from our survey and C-AILM recommendations for both AI system providers and clinical\u00a0laboratories on essential information, verification requirements, and monitoring strategies will inform standardized guideline development.","31":"The relative efficacy of ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) and idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) in relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) was assessed via unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) using data from the CARTITUDE-4 and CARTITUDE-1 (cilta-cel) and KarMMa-3 (ide-cel) trials. This updated MAIC includes longer follow-up and overall survival (OS). An unanchored MAIC was performed utilizing individual patient-level data (IPD) from CARTITUDE-4 [1-3 prior lines of therapy (LOT); n\u2009=\u2009208] and CARTITUDE-1 (3-4 prior LOT; n\u2009=\u200937). Patients fulfilling KarMMa-3 inclusion criteria (2-4 prior LOT, triple-class exposed) were selected, and outcomes were compared against published aggregate KarMMa-3 data. Cilta-cel IPD were weighted to match reported baseline characteristics of KarMMa-3 on key prognostic factors identified a priori. Comparative efficacy was estimated for progression-free survival (PFS), OS, overall response rate, very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate, and complete response (CR) or better rate. Eighty-five patients from CARTITUDE-4 and CARTITUDE-1 were included. After adjustment, patients in the cilta-cel group (effective sample size\u2009=\u200939) had a 58% reduction in PFS risk [hazard ratio (HR) 0.42 (95% CI 0.26-0.68); p\u2009=\u20090.0004] and a 42% reduction in OS risk [HR 0.58 (0.34-0.99); p\u2009=\u20090.0452] versus ide-cel. Patients in the cilta-cel group were significantly more likely to achieve an overall response [relative response ratio (RR) 1.22 (95% CI 1.08-1.38); p\u2009=\u20090.0126] and deeper levels of response [\u2265\u2009VGPR: RR 1.37 (1.19-1.59); p\u2009=\u20090.0009;\u2009\u2265\u2009CR: RR 1.80 (1.49-2.18); p\u2009<\u20090.0001] versus ide-cel. This updated MAIC with longer follow-up time demonstrated significant superiority of cilta-cel over ide-cel in PFS, OS, and response outcomes in patients with triple-class exposed RRMM treated with 2-4 prior LOT. The OS results reinforce the added value of cilta-cel in this population.

We evaluated whether the overall survival (OS) benefit of CPX-351 over 7+3 is confined to molecularly-defined AML subgroups by performing DNA sequencing in 184 patients enrolled in the pivotal phase 3 randomized trial. Patients were categorized hierarchically based on gene mutations: (1) TP53-AML, (2) DDX41-AML, (3) myelodysplasia-related AML (AML-MR) defined by WHO 5th edition, or (4) other-AML. TP53-AML was subclassified as single (TP53single) or multihit (TP53multi) based on the number of alleles altered via mutation, deletion, or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. Two-year OS differed significantly across molecular subgroups: TP53-AML (7%), AML-MR (19%), other-AML (37%), and DDX41-AML (70%) p<0.001. CPX-351 improved survival in AML-MR patients compared to 7+3 (median: 9.7 vs 6.8 months, p=0.037), with no benefit in TP53-AML or other-AML. For patients undergoing transplantation, CPX-351 improved 2-year survival (76% vs 27%; p<0.01), an effect primarily observed in AML-MR. Multivariable analysis confirmed the independent association with survival of both CPX-351 and HCT in AML-MR. TP53multi demonstrated significantly worse survival than TP53single (median 3.8 vs 7.0 months; p=0.004). The OS benefit of CPX-351 observed in the trial was driven by AML-MR with no benefit of CPX-351 in TP53-AML, where the primary prognostic factor was allelic state.

Among patients with <i>ALK-<\/i>rearranged advanced NSCLC (ALK+ aNSCLC), real-world data on treatment patterns, prognostic factors, and survival in the era of contemporary therapy remain limited. We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using deidentified patient, disease, and outcomes data from the AUstralasian thoRacic cancers lOngitudinal cohoRt study and biobAnk (AURORA; ACTRN12625000038493). Eligible patients were diagnosed with ALK+ aNSCLC between 2006 and 2025. Of the 4776 patients with thoracic malignancies enrolled across eight sites (as of April 2025), 218 met the inclusion criteria-the largest reported Australian cohort of ALK+ aNSCLC. All patients were treated in academic centers. The median age was 55 years; 54% were female, 66% were never-smokers, and 41% had participated in a clinical trial. The median overall survival was 90.8 months (95% CI: 69.8-not reached). Nearly all patients (99%) received an ALK inhibitor; 83% in the first-line setting. Treatment sequences evolved over time. Most (68%) received at least two lines of therapy; 21% received 4 or more lines. Smoking status, age, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status were prognostically associated with survival. This study highlights the remarkable survival achievable in the real-world setting for some patients with ALK+ aNSCLC, compared with historical cohorts. Several clinical factors associated with survival were identified. Larger studies are needed to investigate how treatment sequences may be optimized to further improve survival outcomes.","34":"Pre-existing anti-drug antibodies (pre-ADA) pose a significant challenge in the development of biotherapeutics. This article underscores the importance of early pre-ADA screening in mitigating adverse immune responses and optimizing therapeutic efficacy. Drawing on collaborative insights from three pharmaceutical companies, the paper presents a comparative analysis of pre-ADA assessment strategies, including timing, assay formats, and risk thresholds. It details how each company integrates pre-ADA data into immunogenicity risk evaluation, emphasizing the shift toward earlier screening during lead candidate selection. The article also explores assay-specific considerations, such as detection sensitivity and isotype coverage, and outlines criteria for ranking molecular candidates based on pre-ADA reactivity. By characterizing positive pre-ADA responses and proposing standardized practices, the paper offers actionable guidance for incorporating pre-ADA screening into preclinical workflows. This work highlights the growing relevance of pre-ADA assessments in an increasingly complex biopharmaceutical landscape and advocates for harmonized methodologies to support the development of safe and effective medicines.","35":"This large-scale post-marketing surveillance study (163 sites; February 2022-May 2023) evaluated the real-world safety and effectiveness of a newly initiated nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir combination for patients with COVID-19 in Japan.

The safety analysis set comprised 2829 patients (mean [standard deviation] age, 63.1 [18.0] years; mild COVID-19, 80.8%; \u22651 risk factor for progression to severe COVID-19, 97.3%). The most common reason for discontinuing follow-up was symptom improvement (17.1%). Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were observed in 423 (15.0%) patients (incidence [%]): dysgeusia (6.7%), diarrhea (2.6%), taste disturbance (1.5%), nausea (1.2%), vomiting (0.5%), decreased appetite (0.5%), and rash (0.5%). The median times to onset and recovery of these ADRs were 1-2 days and 2-6 days, respectively. Serious ADRs were observed in 6 patients (0.2%). No new safety signals were observed. The study showed that nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir was well tolerated in Japanese patients with COVID-19 in a real-world clinical setting.

Conservative approaches, which rely on the minimal anticipated biological effect level (MABEL), emphasize safety but often result in sub-therapeutic starting doses. These doses limit patients' benefit in severe diseases and prolong dose escalation. To address these limitations, we previously introduced a refined integrative approach from an expert working group. This commentary highlights key enhancements of this refined framework for FIH dose selection, including a revised decision tree, industry case studies, and pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic (PK\/PD) modeling. This approach allows for careful consideration of immunomodulator mechanisms of action and balances risk-benefit profiles. The case studies illustrate the utility of these strategies. Furthermore, the commentary discusses how emerging concepts like Model-Informed Drug Development (MIDD) and quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models can inform and potentially strengthen FIH starting dose selection, aiming to optimize the balance between patient safety and therapeutic efficacy in early-phase trials (148 words).","37":"Nitrosamines (NAs) are a diverse class of mutagenic impurities encompassing both small molecules and structurally complex drug-related NAs, referred to as nitrosamine drug substance-related impurities (NDSRIs). NAs display a broad range of carcinogenic potential, from high carcinogenic potency to being weak or even non-carcinogenic. In vitro Ames tests, conducted with both rat and hamster liver-induced S9, and in vivo transgenic rodent (TGR) mutation assays have been used by pharmaceutical sponsors for hazard identification of NDSRIs. A comparative analysis of Ames tests and TGR results for 33 NDSRIs was performed and revealed an accuracy of 79% between the overall mutagenic calls in the two assays. For NDSRIs with positive TGR results, mutagenic potency estimates were calculated and compared to NAs with robust carcinogenicity and TGR dose-response data. Results from these NAs demonstrated a strong correlation between carcinogenic potency (TD<sub>50<\/sub>) and TGR mutagenic potency (BMDL<sub>50<\/sub>) (r<sup>2<\/sup> = 0.95), which supports the use of TGR data for both hazard identification and acceptable intake (AI) determination. By integrating quantitative risk assessment tools with TGR assays, this work contributes to a more robust framework for evaluating NA-associated risks.","38":"The continued evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) underscores the ongoing need for effective antiviral therapies targeting this now-endemic virus. Ibuzatrelvir, a second-generation SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitor, has demonstrated potent antiviral activity without the need for a pharmacokinetic booster such as ritonavir. In the present study, we show that ibuzatrelvir maintained its antiviral efficacy against all major SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating between 2020 and 2024 (alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3), lambda (\u03bb), delta (\u03b4), mu (\u03bc) and omicron (\u03bf)). Additionally, we characterized the in vitro resistance profile of ibuzatrelvir by selecting viral mutations under drug pressure. This approach identified several resistance-associated amino acid substitutions in Mpro, including T21I, L232R, and S144A, as well as substitution combinations E166V+L232R and S144A+L232R+L253L\/F. Among these, the E166V+L232R double substitution conferred the highest level of resistance to ibuzatrelvir. Surveillance studies have shown very low prevalence of the E166V substitution in both GISAID datasets and in breakthrough cases from clinical trials. Cross-resistance testing revealed that this double substitution retained susceptibility to remdesivir and also conferred resistance to nirmatrelvir. Ibuzatrelvir and nirmatrelvir remained active against viruses containing the ensitrelvir-specific resistance Mpro substitution M49L. The sustained efficacy of ibuzatrelvir against circulating variants, combined with the low prevalence of the E166V substitution, supports its continued evaluation in phase 3 studies.","39":"Structured educational programs for physicians in healthy longevity medicine (HLM) remain scarce. No published data yet document the impact of longevity-focused medical education on physicians. This study assesses the ramification of the HLM curriculum, certified by the American Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), on physicians' confidence in knowledge of HLM and clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of accredited HLM education on physicians' confidence in knowledge, and practice patterns, examining self-reported integration of HLM principles, professional attitudes, and career trajectories to determine the translational value of structured curricula in the emerging medical discipline. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March and April 2024 among physicians who had completed accredited HLM courses between January 2023 and February 2024. Invitations were sent globally to 590 eligible physicians; trainees and students were excluded. A total of 113 respondents completed the survey and were included in the analysis. The survey assessed self-reported changes in clinical implementation, confidence in HLM-related knowledge, and professional attitudes following course completion. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were performed (p < .05, 95% CIs). Respondents represented 42 nationalities and were primarily trained in family medicine (27.4%) and internal medicine (15.93%). Overall, 96.5% reported increased confidence in HLM-related knowledge, with 47.8% indicating substantial improvement. More than half (55.8%) reported integrating HLM principles into routine patient assessments, and 80.5% reported more frequent discussions related to healthspan-focused care. Additionally, 23% initiated aging biomarker testing, 48.7% increased testing frequency, 52.2% reported a shift in their perspective on aging, and 73.5% anticipated full integration of HLM into mainstream medicine. Physicians practicing in specialized care demonstrated higher odds of reporting increased confidence in HLM knowledge compared with those in primary and preventive care (OR 4.46, 95% CI 1.55-12.79, p = .005). Accredited education in HLM is associated with enhanced confidence in HLM knowledge, increased clinical engagement with HLM practices, and a shift in aging-related care paradigms. These findings underscore the critical role of structured HLM curricula in bridging the translational gap between geroscience and everyday medical practice. Nevertheless, systemic healthcare barriers impede widespread implementation, warranting policy-level strategies to support healthspan-oriented education and care models.","40":"To describe next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing rates for deleterious homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations and time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) among US patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). Data from oncology centers included in the nationwide (US-based) Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine, Inc. Metastatic PC Clinico-Genomic Database (1\/1\/2011-12\/31\/2022) and Core Registry (1\/1\/2013-12\/31\/2023) were evaluated. Patients who initiated treatment for mCSPC (index date) after 1\/1\/2018 and received an HRR alteration test were included. TTNT and NGS testing patterns were described overall and among White, non-White (i.e., Black, Asian, Hispanic, other), and Black patient subgroups. TTNT was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and annual NGS testing rates were assessed from 2018-2023 using the Core Registry. In total, 1,121 HRR-tested patients with mCSPC were included. HRR (BRCA1\/2) alterations were observed among 17.4% (12.7%) of White patients, 16.5% (10.9%) of non-White patients, and 15.2% (9.7%) of Black patients. Non-White patients had the shortest median (months) TTNT (17.0; 60.6% with next treatment by 24 months), followed by White (19.2; 56.1% with next treatment by 24 months) and Black patients (21.2; 54.7% with next treatment by 24 months). Although Black patients had descriptively lower testing rates than White patients in 2018 (4.2%), the rates increased overall and became numerically comparable between racial groups by 2023 (29.8%). Although NGS testing rates have increased, with less disparity in most recent years, the testing rates are unacceptable for patients with mCSPC, overall and across racial groups, with the majority of patients progressing to the next treatment by 24 months.","41":"Accurate prediction of the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of small-molecule drug candidates is a critical aspect of pharmaceutical research. Fast and reliable PK predictions can accelerate compound optimization cycles, reduce animal testing, and enhance the quality of molecules advancing to human studies. Although physiologically based PK (PBPK) models are well-established for compound selection, their application in early discovery faces limitations due to low throughput and the requirement for substantial <i>in vitro<\/i> data. Recently, high-throughput PBPK (HT-PBPK) methods have become possible, offering scalable, parallel PBPK simulations that can be executed on thousands of compounds within minutes. Additionally, advancements in machine learning (ML) have enabled the substitution of <i>in vitro<\/i> data by high-quality <i>in silico<\/i> predictions that are based solely on chemical structures. In this study, the performance of a corporate HT-PBPK application, called SwiftPK, that leverages the HTPK simulation module included in a commercial software package was evaluated for predicting ten primary and secondary PK endpoints for a large (>9000 compounds) set of rodent PK data. Utilizing a corporate ML pipeline, all <i>in vitro<\/i> parameter inputs were replaced with <i>in silico<\/i> predictions. This approach is particularly relevant for early stage project phases, such as lead identification, as well as for external collaborations where experimental data are unavailable. The findings demonstrate the highly predictive performance of the HT-PBPK approach, with most endpoints predicted within a three- to four-fold error. Performance improves after filtering for compounds that are predicted, based on structure alone, to be cleared by hepatic metabolism (Extended Clearance Classification System class 2) and when using ML inputs that demonstrate high confidence. The results highlight the key prerequisites for successful application in early phase projects: predicted primary elimination pathway accuracy and prediction quality. This study is expected to inspire more organizations to incorporate HT-PBPK into their discovery pipelines, expediting the development of safe and effective novel medicines for patients.","42":"Inclisiran, a small interfering RNA targeting hepatic PCSK9, was previously studied in various adult patient populations, but it has not yet been assessed in paediatric patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH), a genetic disorder characterised by elevated LDL cholesterol. The ORION-16 study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inclisiran treatment in adolescents with HeFH. ORION-16 was a two-part (1-year double-blind, 1-year open-label), randomised, phase 3 trial at 51 sites across 26 countries. In Part 1, adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) with HeFH and elevated LDL cholesterol on maximally tolerated statin treatment with or without other lipid-lowering therapy were randomly assigned 2:1 (via interactive response technology) to either inclisiran sodium 300 mg subcutaneously or placebo (administered on days 1, 90, and 270); in Part 2, all patients received inclisiran (days 360 [only patients previously assigned to receive placebo], 450, and 630). The primary endpoint was the percentage change in LDL cholesterol from baseline to day 330, assessed in all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Endpoints in Part 2 were analysed in all patients who entered and received at least one dose of study drug in Part 2. ORION-16 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04652726) and is completed. Between Feb 17, 2021, and Dec 14, 2022, 141 patients were randomly assigned (93 to inclisiran, 48 to placebo; median age 15\u00b71 years [IQR 13\u00b74-16\u00b78]; 75 [53%] female; 128 [91%] White). In Part 1, the least squares mean percentage change in LDL cholesterol from baseline to day 330 was -27\u00b71% in the inclisiran group and 1\u00b74% in the placebo group, with a between-group difference of -28\u00b75% (95% CI -35\u00b78 to -21\u00b73; p<0\u00b70001). In Part 2, at day 720, a mean percentage change in LDL cholesterol from baseline of -33\u00b77% (SD 24\u00b70) was observed. Inclisiran was well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to studies in adults. Injection site reactions were more frequent with inclisiran (15 [16%] of 93 patients) than with placebo (three [6%] of 48) in Part 1 (13 [9%] of 139 in Part 2); all were mild and did not lead to study drug discontinuation. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, and no deaths during the study. In adolescents with HeFH, inclisiran was effective in lowering LDL cholesterol, with sustained efficacy over 2 years, and was well tolerated. These results support inclisiran as a potentially useful addition for the treatment of adolescents with HeFH, providing an infrequent dosing regimen.

This study aimed to investigate real-world adherence and clinical outcomes of ofatumumab-treated patients in the UK and looked at the impact of a patient support program called Kesimpta Connect (KC PSP) on these outcomes. This retrospective observational cohort study examined adherence to ofatumumab in 155 RMS patients recruited from six UK MS centres. The primary objective of the study was to describe the medication possession ratio (MPR) adherence of ofatumumab treated patients over a 13-month period. The study also looked at clinical effectiveness measures, including change in annualized relapse rates (ARR). Safety and secondary-care use was also assessed in this study. 103 patients had data available to be assessed for adherence and clinical effectiveness. 87 % (n=90) of patients had an MPR adherence of 0.80 or greater and higher proportion of non-KC PSP users reported adherence of greater than 0.80 than KC PSP users (98.4 % vs 69.2 %). The total ARR decreased during the follow-up period from 0.33 (95 % CI 0.23-0.40) prior to ofatumumab initiation to 0.06 (95 % CI 0.01-0.11) 12-months after initiation. In terms of safety, 38.1 % (n=59\/155) patients reported experiencing an adverse event during the follow-up period; one was reported to be severe. However, no patients reported discontinuing ofatumumab during the study follow-up period. This study provides evidence of good adherence for RMS patients using ofatumumab. Further, there is evidence of clinical effectiveness based on reduction in ARR post-ofatumumab initiation, as well as tolerability and a favourable safety profile. The results of this study support the continued use of ofatumumab in providing effective RMS disease management in the UK NHS.","44":"Canakinumab was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in 2018, following an open-label, single-arm phase III study performed in 19 Japanese patients with sJIA. Given this limited sample size, Japanese regulatory authorities required an all-case post-marketing surveillance study as part of the approval conditions, aiming to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of canakinumab in Japanese patients with sJIA in clinical practice and characterise the clinical course of any cases of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). This was a multicentre, central registration, all-case, uncontrolled, open-label, special drug use investigation, including all patients who received canakinumab for the treatment of sJIA between 2 July 2018 and 20 December 2024. Patients were treated according to the investigators' routine clinical practice and observed for up to 104\u00a0weeks. The safety analysis population included 125 patients with a median duration of treatment (including interruptions) of 710.0 (range 1-729) days and median total number of doses of 25.0 (range 1-29). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 91 out of 125 patients (72.8%), with the most common being relapse, worsening or exacerbation of Still's disease (24 patients, 19.2%), followed by upper respiratory tract inflammation (18 patients, 14.4%). Serious related AEs occurred in 22 patients (17.6%), with the most common being haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH; 5 patients, 4.0%). A total of ten MAS-related AEs were reported; all were cases of HLH and were considered serious, and all were resolved or were resolving at the time of reporting. Effectiveness outcomes, including glucocorticoid tapering, disease activity reduction and inflammatory marker normalisation, were durable through 2 years of treatment. Canakinumab showed a favourable long-term safety profile and sustained effectiveness in Japanese patients with sJIA inadequately controlled by existing therapies. No new safety concerns emerged, and the safety profile was comparable to that observed in the earlier phase III study.","45":"As emicizumab shares no sequence homology with factor VIII (FVIII), in patients with haemophilia A, haemostasis can be restored irrespective of the presence of FVIII inhibitors. Emicizumab, therefore, substantially improved previously available prophylactic options. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using emicizumab prophylaxis therapy compared to recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) prophylaxis for the treatment of severe haemophilia A. A Markov model from a Chinese healthcare system perspective using annual cycles was constructed to evaluate the lifelong costs and effectiveness. All patients started at age zero in a non-inhibitor state, treated with either emicizumab or rFVIII prophylaxis. On-demand rFVIII was given upon breakthrough bleeding for both groups. A part of severe patients developed FVIII inhibitors resulting from on-demand treatment. For patients with inhibitors, those previously treated with rFVIII prophylaxis switched to a recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) on-demand only therapy, whereas those previously on emicizumab kept the same prophylactic regimen with rFVIIa for breakthrough bleeds. One immune tolerance induction (ITI) was allowed to eradicate inhibitors. Model inputs, including utility values, bleeding rates, adverse event rates and the success rate of ITI were from HAVEN 1 and 3 trials and the other literature. The results of both the 0-12 age group and lifetime simulations demonstrated a dominant economic advantage of emicizumab prophylaxis over rFVIII prophylaxis therapy. Severe haemophilia A patients treated by emicizumab prophylaxis can benefit both patients' QoL and economic outcomes compared to those treated by rFVIII prophylaxis.","46":"Data are limited regarding national clinician awareness, testing, and treatment of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. We conducted a national survey of US clinicians to investigate these issues. An internet-based survey of awareness, testing and treatment of Lp(a) was administered by a medical survey company to clinicians who have been in practice \u22655 years in the US or its territories. 2002 clinicians completed the survey: 47 % were primary care, 35 % cardiology, 9 % endocrinology, and 9 % neurology. 28 % were female, 24 % Asian, 4 % Hispanic, and 3 % Black. <i>Awareness:<\/i> 81 % of respondents agreed Lp(a) is a significant risk driver for cardiovascular disease (CVD). 77 % and 75 % agreed knowing Lp(a) would help in risk stratification and increase patient engagement, respectively. <i>Testing:<\/i> 41 % of respondents agreed with universal testing of Lp(a). Most agreed Lp(a) should be measured in those with premature (73 %), family history of premature (71 %), or recurrent CVD events (68 %). <i>Treatment:<\/i> 77 % reported having CVD outcome data were felt to be very important for a new therapy, followed by long-term efficacy\/safety data (69 %), real-world data (53 %), magnitude of Lp(a) reduction (21 %), dosing frequency (17 %), and mechanism of action (12 %). Clinicians reported being most likely to consider prescribing Lp(a)-targeted therapy with proven CVD benefit among patients with premature (47 %) or recurrent (51 %) CVD events. Most clinicians agree knowing the Lp(a) level can improve risk assessment and patient engagement. Patients with premature or recurrent CVD events are most likely to be targeted for Lp(a) testing and for prescribing possible future Lp(a)-targeted therapies.","47":"Exposure-response analyses are central to dose selection in drug development. The estimand framework, formalized in ICH E9(R1) regulatory guidance, provides a structured approach to define scientific objectives with precision. We apply the estimand framework to dose-exposure-response analyses. For simulated example studies inspired by real-world scenarios, we define dose-response estimands of clinical interest. The estimands are formalized using the potential outcome notation. Assumptions on the setup of the studies and the relation between treatment, exposure and response are expressed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The estimand is transformed using the assumption into expressions to identify the estimand based on the observed data. Three types of expressions are obtained. First, a pooled dose-exposure-response (DER) analysis that corresponds to a standard DER analysis as executed for many projects. Second, a pooled, covariate adjusted dose-response (DR) analysis, and third summaries of the outcomes in each randomized cohort. In our example, DER provides more precise estimates than DR as judged by the mean square error (MSE) of repeated simulation estimation. This work advances methodological rigor in DER analyses by integrating with causal inference methodologies and the estimand framework, enabling clearer interpretation of modeling assumptions and results. This has important concrete advantages. We obtain different estimation methods for the same estimand that may be compared to validate them. The potential for bias in the different estimation methods can be formally assessed. The proposed approach provides a generalizable strategy to improve exposure-response analyses for dose selection, particularly when the relevant evidence includes data from multiple studies.","48":"Accurate assessment of tissue distribution for oligonucleotide therapeutic (ONT) drug candidates is essential for understanding pharmacokinetic behavior and predicting therapeutic efficacy. ONTs present a unique challenge with their rapid systemic clearance coupled with prolonged tissue retention, making comprehensive tissue concentration evaluation critical for successful drug development. The IQ Consortium Tissue Concentration Working Group surveyed member companies about their current tissue concentration assessment methods to understand industry practices and identify areas for improvement. Most companies reported that ONTs still represent a relatively small portion of their pre-candidate selection portfolios, reflecting the evolving nature of this therapeutic modality. siRNAs dominated development efforts across surveyed organizations, followed by antisense oligonucleotides, indicating clear therapeutic class preferences within the industry. Assessment strategies varied considerably across organizations, highlighting different approaches to resource allocation and risk management. While some companies routinely evaluate tissue concentrations for all ONT programs regardless of indication or target, others take a more selective, program-dependent approach based on compound characteristics and therapeutic objectives. Despite this strategic variability, there was universal reliance on LC-MS for quantification, often supplemented with qPCR\/RT-qPCR and hybridization assays for comprehensive analytical coverage. All surveyed companies integrate tissue concentration data into translational pharmacokinetic modeling efforts, yet few have adopted physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models as standard practice. Companies recognize the value of improving ONT tissue distribution assessment through standardized methodology tailored to specific oligonucleotide classes.","49":"Amide bond formation is widely used in pharmaceutical synthesis, typically involving stoichiometric coupling reagents to activate carboxylic acid substrates for a condensation reaction. As an alternative approach, we repurposed aldehyde dehydrogenases into oxidative amidases by creating a more hydrophobic and spacious catalytic pocket for amines to capture the thioester intermediate. This biocatalyst efficiently facilitates the formation of amide bonds between diverse aldehydes and amines. We also developed a two-step enzymatic cascade to synthesize amides from broadly available aliphatic alcohols. This biocatalytic strategy enabled the redesign of synthetic routes for five drug molecules. Our findings highlight the potential of oxidative amidases in advancing the synthesis of structurally diverse drug molecules through efficient amide bond formation."},"url":{"0":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667983\/","1":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41667683\/","2":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41665798\/","3":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41663073\/","4":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41662384\/","5":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41655868\/","6":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41655066\/","7":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41653611\/","8":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41652666\/","9":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41650823\/","10":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41647713\/","11":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41647027\/","12":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41646210\/","13":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41645877\/","14":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41644530\/","15":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41644383\/","16":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41644364\/","17":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41643182\/","18":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41642398\/","19":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41641373\/","20":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41639499\/","21":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41639230\/","22":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41638377\/","23":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41636724\/","24":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41636278\/","25":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41635454\/","26":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41635092\/","27":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41634008\/","28":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41633910\/","29":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41633900\/","30":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41630421\/","31":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41627370\/","32":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41628350\/","33":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41626535\/","34":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41622783\/","35":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41621946\/","36":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41621794\/","37":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41621793\/","38":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41621598\/","39":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41620952\/","40":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41620128\/","41":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41617209\/","42":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41616799\/","43":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41616461\/","44":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41615628\/","45":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41614327\/","46":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41613345\/","47":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41612735\/","48":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41612090\/","49":"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/41610224\/"}}
